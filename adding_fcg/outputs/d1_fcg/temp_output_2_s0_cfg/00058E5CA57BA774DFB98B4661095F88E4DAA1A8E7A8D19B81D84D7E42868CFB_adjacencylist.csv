The following is an APK function call graph provided as an edge list, focusing on the relationships between functions within specific classes. Each edge represents a caller/callee relationship where the first element is the caller function, and the second element is the callee function. Only the relationships relevant to the specific class context are included.

Given this, is the following snippet of code malicious?
#start code
public class RuntimeAdplatTtsactivity1 extends RuntimeActivity { } 
#end code
Explain in 100 words.[/INST]  No, the code is not malicious. It is a class definition for a custom activity called RuntimeAdplatTtsactivity1, which extends the RuntimeActivity class. The class is not doing anything malicious, it is just defining a new activity that can be used in the app.</s>"
