#end code[/INST]  This code defines a custom `WebChromeClient` class named `F` that extends the default `WebChromeClient` class. The `F` class has a private field named `a` of type `WA`, which is a custom class that represents a web view. The `F` class also has a constructor that takes a `WA` object as a parameter and assigns it to the `a` field.

The `onProgressChanged` method is overridden to update the progress bar and log a message to the console. The method takes two parameters: `webView` and `i`. The `webView` parameter is a reference to the web view that is being loaded, and the `i` parameter is an integer that represents the progress of the loading process.

The method first updates the progress bar by calling the `setProgress` method on the `a` field, passing in the progress value multiplied by 100. It then logs a message to the console using the `WA.a` method, passing in the `a` field and a string that represents the progress value. If the progress value is equal to or greater than 100, the method calls the `WA.a` method again with a null value to hide the progress bar.</s>","This code defines a custom `WebChromeClient` class named `F` that extends the default `WebChromeClient` class.

The `Notification` object is created using the `Notification` class from the Android SDK, and the image is set using the `setImageViewBitmap` method. The `r` class also provides a method for canceling all notifications.

The `r` class is a singleton, meaning that there is only one instance of it, and it is created when the `a` method is called for the first time. The `a` method takes a `Context` object as a parameter and returns an instance of the `r` class.

The `a` method takes several parameters that are used to create the `Notification` object, including the icon, ticker text, and the intent to launch when the notification is clicked. The `a` method also takes a string parameter that represents the URL of the image to be displayed in the notification.

The `a` method first inflates a `View` object from the layout file, and then finds the `ImageView` object in the view hierarchy. It then sets the image for the `ImageView` object using the `setImageViewBitmap` method. Finally, it creates a `Notification` object and sets its icon, ticker text, and content view using the `Notification` class.

The `a` method also has a try-catch block that catches any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the method. If an exception occurs, the method will log the error message to the console.

#end code[/INST]  This code defines a class named `v` that has several static methods for handling images. The class has a private constructor, and all the methods are static.

The `a` method takes a `Context` object, a `String` representing the image URL, and a `y` object that contains the image's dimensions. It returns a `Bitmap` object that represents the image. The method first checks if the image file exists on the device, and if it does, it decodes the image using the `BitmapFactory` class. If the image file does not exist, the method returns `null`.

The `b` method is a static initializer that creates a new instance of the `v` class and assigns it to the `a` field.

If it is not null, the method extracts the image URL and the image bitmap from the message object. If the bitmap is not null, the method adds the bitmap to the cache using the image URL as the key.

The method then retrieves the queue of image URLs from the cache using the image URL as the key. If the queue is not null, the method iterates through the queue and removes all the elements from it.

1. It creates two `Handler` objects, `handler` and `handler2`.
2. It calls the `a()` method of the `v` class, passing in `this.b`, `""/adfeiwo/appwall/image""`, and `this.c` as arguments. This method returns a `String` object.

4. It sends a message to the `handler` object, passing in the `String` object and the `Bitmap` object as arguments. The message is sent to the `handler2` object.

This method takes two parameters: `z`, which is a `boolean`, and `str`, which is a `String`. It first checks if `z` is `true`, and if so, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it appends the `str` parameter to a string and then checks if the resulting string is not `null`. If it is not `null`, it appends the `this.b` field to the string and then calls the `com.feiwoone.coverscreen.a.j.b` method with the resulting string as the third parameter.

However, based on the name of the method and the parameters it is called with, it appears to be a method that writes the string to a file.</s>","This code defines a class named `s` that implements the `ae` interface.
