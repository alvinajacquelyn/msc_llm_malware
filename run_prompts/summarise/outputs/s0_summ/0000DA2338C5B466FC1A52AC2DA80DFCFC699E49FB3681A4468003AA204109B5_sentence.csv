In the onAnimationEnd method, the view's visibility is set to 0."

It then retrieves a `Queue` object from a `ConcurrentHashMap` named `concurrentHashMap` using the `String` object as a key, and if the `Queue` object is not null, it iterates over the `Queue` object and calls the `a` method on each object, passing in the `BitmapDrawable` object as a parameter.</s>","This code defines a custom `Handler` class named `e` that extends the `Handler` class in Android.
