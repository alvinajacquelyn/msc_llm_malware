This code is a Java class named `a` that contains several methods and fields. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. `public final class a`: This line declares a new class named `a` that is public and final. This means that the class cannot be extended or modified.
2. `private static boolean a = false`: This line declares a private static field named `a` that is a boolean and is initialized to `false`.
3. `public static Class a(Context context, Class cls)`: This line declares a public static method named `a` that takes two parameters: `context` and `cls`. The method returns a `Class` object.
4. `Class<?> cls2;`: This line declares a variable named `cls2` that is a `Class` object.
5. `try {`: This line starts a try block.
6. `ActivityInfo[] activityInfoArr = context.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(context.getApplicationInfo().packageName, 2).receivers;`: This line retrieves an array of `ActivityInfo` objects from the `PackageManager` using the `getPackageInfo` method. The `receivers` field of the `PackageInfo` object is used to retrieve the array of `ActivityInfo` objects. The `2` in the method call is used to retrieve the receivers.
7. `if (activityInfoArr != null) {`: This line checks if the `activityInfoArr` array is not null. If it is not null, the code inside the if statement is executed.
8. `int i = 0;`: This line declares a variable named `i` and initializes it to 0.
9. `while (true) {`: This line starts a while loop that runs indefinitely.
10. `int i2 = i;`: This line declares a variable named `i2` and initializes it to the current value of `i`.
11. `if (i2 >= activityInfoArr.length) {`: This line checks if the current value of `i2` is greater than or equal to the length of the `activityInfoArr` array. If it is, the code inside the if statement is executed.
12. `try {`: This line starts a try block.
13. `cls2 = Class.forName(activityInfoArr[i2].name);`: This line retrieves a `Class` object from the `Class.forName` method using the `name` field of the `ActivityInfo` object at the current value of `i2` in the `activityInfoArr` array.
14. `} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {`: This line starts a catch block for the `ClassNotFoundException` exception.
15. `e.printStackTrace();`: This line prints the stack trace of the exception to the console.
16. `}`: This line ends the catch block.
17. `if (cls.isAssignableFrom(cls2)) {`: This line checks if the `cls` class is assignable from the `cls2` class. If it is, the code inside the if statement is executed.
18. `return cls2;`: This line returns the `cls2` class.
19. `i = i2 + 1;`: This line increments the value of `i` by 1.
20. `}`: This line ends the while loop.
21. `}`: This line ends the if statement.
22. `return null;`: This line returns null.
3. `public static void a(android.content.Context r14) {`: This line declares a public static method named `a` that takes a single parameter named `r14`. The method does not return anything.
4. `throw new UnsupportedOperationException(""Method not decompiled: com.arqi.pow.a.a(android.content.Context):void"");`: This line throws a new `UnsupportedOperationException` with the message ""Method not decompiled: com.arqi.pow.a.a(android.content.Context):void"". This is a special exception that is used to indicate that the method has not been decompiled.
5. `}`: This line ends the class.

In summary, this code defines a class named `a` that contains two methods: `a` and `a`. The `a` method takes two parameters: `context` and `cls`, and returns a `Class` object. The `a` method also contains a try block that retrieves an array of `ActivityInfo` objects from the `PackageManager` using the `getPackageInfo` method, and then checks if the `cls` class is assignable from the `Class` object retrieved from the `ActivityInfo` array. If it is, the method returns the `Class` object. The `a` method also contains a catch block that prints the stack trace of the `ClassNotFoundException` exception to the console. The `a` method also contains a second method named `a` that takes a single parameter named `r14`, and throws a new `UnsupportedOperationException` with the message ""Method not decompiled: com.arqi.pow.a.a(android.content.Context):void"".</s>

* `b`: This is a static method that returns the path to the directory where the classes are stored. It is a wrapper around the `b` field, and it is used to ensure that the directory path is properly formatted.
* `c`: This is a static method that loads a class from the classpath. It takes a string argument that represents the name of the class to load, and it returns the `Class` object for that class.
* `d`: This is a static method that executes a method on an object. It takes a string argument that represents the name of the method to execute, an array of objects that represent the arguments to the method, and an array of classes that represent the types of the arguments. It returns the result of the method execution.
* `a(Context context)`: This is a static method that creates a new instance of the `d` class if one does not already exist. It takes a `Context` object as an argument, which is used to determine the path to the directory where the classes are stored. It returns the singleton instance of the `d` class.
* `a(String str)`: This is a method that loads a class from the classpath. It takes a string argument that represents the name of the class to load, and it returns the `Class` object for that class.
* `a()`: This is a method that executes a method on an object.

This code defines a class called `e` that has a private static field called `a` of type `Peewr`. The field `b` is also private static and is initially set to `false`.

The `a` method takes a `Context` object as a parameter and performs the following actions:

1. If `b` is `true` and `a` is not `null`, it unregisters the `a` receiver from the `Context` object.
2. It then tries to register a new receiver called `a` with the `Context` object, using an `IntentFilter` that filters for the actions `b.y`, `b.z`, and `b.A`.
3. If the registration is successful, it sets `b` to `true`.
4. If an exception occurs during the registration process, it catches the exception and does nothing.

This is a Java class named `g` that is used to perform reflection on a given class. The class has several private fields and methods, but the most important ones are:

* `a`: a static field that stores a reference to an instance of the `g` class.
* `a(Context, String)`: a static method that creates a new instance of the `g` class and initializes it with the given `Context` and `String`.
* `b(String)`: a method that sets the `String` value of the `e` field.
* `a(String, Object[], Class[])`: a method that calls the `a` method of the `f` field with the given `String`, `Object[]`, and `Class[]` arguments.
* `a(String, Object, Class)`: a method that calls the `a` method of the `f` field with the given `String`, `Object`, and `Class` arguments.
* `a(String)`: a method that calls the `a` method of the `f` field with the given `String` argument.

The `g` class is designed to be used as a singleton, meaning that there is only one instance of the class at any given time. The `a` method is used to create a new instance of the class if it doesn't already exist, and the `b` method is used to set the `String` value of the `e` field. The `a` method with the `String`, `Object[]`, and `Class[]` arguments is used to call the `a` method of the `f` field with the given arguments.

The `a` method with the `String` argument is a convenience method that calls the `a` method with the `String`, `Object[]`, and `Class[]` arguments.

The `g` class is used to perform reflection on a given class, which means that it can be used to get information about the class, such as its fields and methods, and to call methods on the class. The `f` field is used to store a reference to an instance of the `f` class, which is used to perform the actual reflection. The `b` field is used to store a reference to an instance of the `d` class, which is used to perform the actual reflection. The `c` field is used to store a reference to a `Class` object that represents the class that is being reflected on.

This is a Java code snippet for an Android activity class named `Peewa`. The class extends the `Activity` class and overrides several methods to handle configuration changes, create the activity, and handle key events.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `public class Peewa extends Activity {`: This line declares the `Peewa` class, which extends the `Activity` class.
2. `@Override public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration configuration) {`: This method is called when the device's configuration changes, such as when the screen orientation changes. The `onConfigurationChanged` method is overridden to call the `a` method of the `g` class, passing in the `this` reference, the `b.b` constant, and the `configuration` object.
3. `super.onConfigurationChanged(configuration);`: This line calls the `onConfigurationChanged` method of the superclass, which is the `Activity` class.
4. `try {`: This line starts a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
5. `g.a(this,b.b).a(b.x,configuration,Configuration.class);`: This line calls the `a` method of the `g` class, passing in the `this` reference, the `b.b` constant, and the `configuration` object. The `a` method is responsible for handling the configuration change.
6. `} catch (Exception e) {`: This line catches any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
7. `e.printStackTrace();`: This line prints the stack trace of the exception to the console.
8. `@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {`: This method is called when the activity is created. The `onCreate` method is overridden to call the `a` method of the `g` class, passing in the `this` reference, the `b.b` constant, and the `bundle` object. The `a` method is responsible for creating the activity.
9. `super.onCreate(bundle);`: This line calls the `onCreate` method of the superclass, which is the `Activity` class.
10. `requestWindowFeature(1);`: This line requests a specific feature of the activity's window, which is not specified in the code.
11. `try {`: This line starts a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
12. `g a=g.a(this,b.b);`: This line creates a new instance of the `g` class and assigns it to the `a` variable.
13. `a.a(b.r,this,Activity.class);`: This line calls the `a` method of the `g` class, passing in the `b.r` constant, the `this` reference, and the `Activity.class` object. The `a` method is responsible for creating the activity.
14. `a.a(b.s,bundle,Bundle.class);`: This line calls the `a` method of the `g` class, passing in the `b.s` constant, the `bundle` object, and the `Bundle.class` object. The `a` method is responsible for creating the activity.
15. `new e();`: This line creates a new instance of the `e` class.
16. `e.a(getApplicationContext());`: This line calls the `a` method of the `e` class, passing in the `getApplicationContext()` method. The `a` method is responsible for creating the activity.
17. `} catch (Exception e) {`: This line catches any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
18. `e.printStackTrace();`: This line prints the stack trace of the exception to the console.
19. `@Override public boolean onKeyDown(int i, KeyEvent keyEvent) {`: This method is called when a key is pressed. The `onKeyDown` method is overridden to call the `a` method of the `c` class, passing in the `this` reference, the `i` parameter, and the `keyEvent` object. The `a` method is responsible for handling the key event.
20. `try {`: This line starts a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
21. `c.a(this,i,keyEvent);`: This line calls the `a` method of the `c` class, passing in the `this` reference, the `i` parameter, and the `keyEvent` object. The `a` method is responsible for handling the key event.
22. `return true;`: This line returns `true` to indicate that the key event was handled.
33. `} catch (Exception e) {`: This line catches any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.
34. `e.printStackTrace();`: This line prints the stack trace of the exception to the console.
35. `return true;`: This line returns `true` to indicate that the key event was handled.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class `z` has a private static boolean field named `a` that is set to `true`.
2. The class `z` has a public static method named `Log` that takes two string parameters and does nothing with them.
3. The class `z` has a private static method named `a` that takes three parameters: an integer `i`, a boolean `z`, and a string `str`. This method returns `true` if the current time is before the time specified in `str` (in the format `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm`), and `false` otherwise. If `str` is null or an empty string, the method returns `true`.
4. The class `z` has a public static method named `a` that takes four parameters: a `Context` object, an integer `i`, an integer `i2`, and a string `str`. This method calls the private `a` method with the parameters `i`, `false`, and `str`, and then calls the private `a` method with the parameters `i2`, `true`, and `str`. If both calls to `a` return `true`, the method returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.
5. The class `z` has a public static method named `get` that takes a string parameter `str`. This method returns `true` if the current time is after the time specified in `str` (in the format `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm`), and `false` otherwise.

This code defines a custom `BroadcastReceiver` class called `Aiqir`. The `BroadcastReceiver` is defined in the `android.content` package, and it is used to receive broadcasts sent by the Android system.

The `onReceive()` method is called when a broadcast is received by the `BroadcastReceiver`. This method takes two parameters: `context` and `intent`. The `context` parameter is a reference to the Android context, and the `intent` parameter is a reference to the broadcast intent that was sent.

The `onReceive()` method calls the `a()` method of the `c` class, passing in the `context` and `intent` parameters. The `a()` method is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it is not possible to determine what it does.

Overall, this code defines a custom `BroadcastReceiver` class that can receive broadcasts and pass them to a method called `a()` in a class called `c`.</s>

This code defines a class named `d` that has a static method named `a`. The method takes a `Context` object as an argument and performs the following actions:

1. If the `b` flag is set to `true` and the `a` object is not `null`, it unregisters the `a` object as a receiver for the `b.r`, `b.s`, and `b.t` actions.
2. It creates an `IntentFilter` object and adds the `b.r`, `b.s`, and `b.t` actions to it.
3. If the `a` object is `null`, it creates a new `m` object and assigns it to the `a` variable.
4. It registers the `a` object as a receiver for the `IntentFilter` object.
5. It sets the `b` flag to `true`.

The `b` flag is a static variable that is used to keep track of whether the `a` object has been registered as a receiver. The `a` object is a static variable that is used to store the receiver object.

This code is a Java class that provides methods for decoding images and raw data from Android resources.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class is named `ResourceDecoder` and it has three static methods: `decodeImage`, `decodeRaw`, and `decodeAssets`.
2. The `decodeImage` method takes a `Context` object and an integer resource ID as input, and returns an `ImageInfo` object that contains the decoded image data.
3. The `decodeRaw` method takes a `Context` object and an integer resource ID as input, and returns a `RawInfo` object that contains the decoded raw data.
4. The `decodeAssets` method takes a `Context` object and a string file name as input, and returns a `RawInfo` object that contains the decoded raw data from the assets folder.
5. The `ImageInfo` and `RawInfo` classes are inner classes of the `ResourceDecoder` class, and they contain the decoded data and other information about the decoded data.
6. The `decodeImage` method uses the `BitmapFactory` class to decode the image data from the resource, and it returns an `ImageInfo` object that contains the decoded image data.
7. The `decodeRaw` method uses the `InputStream` class to read the raw data from the resource, and it returns a `RawInfo` object that contains the decoded raw data.
8. The `decodeAssets` method uses the `InputStream` class to read the raw data from the assets folder, and it returns a `RawInfo` object that contains the decoded raw data.
9. The `decodeImage` and `decodeRaw` methods use the `BitmapFactory.Options` class to specify the desired image format and other options for decoding the image or raw data.
10. The `decodeImage` and `decodeRaw` methods use the `GL1Lib.nativeCheckMemoryAvalable()` method to check if there is enough memory available to decode the image or raw data. If there is not enough memory, the methods return `null`.
11. The `decodeImage` and `decodeRaw` methods use the `Log` class to log error messages if there is an error decoding the image or raw data.
12. The `decodeAssets` method uses the `Log` class to log error messages if there is an error decoding the raw data from the assets folder.

This code defines a utility class called `CharEscapers` that provides methods for escaping and unescaping characters in URIs. The class is marked as `final` to prevent inheritance and modification.

The class contains four static methods:

1. `escapeUri(String value)`: This method takes a string `value` and returns a new string with all characters escaped according to the rules of the `PercentEscaper` class. The `PercentEscaper` class is used to escape characters that are not allowed in URIs.
2. `decodeUri(String uri)`: This method takes a string `uri` and returns a new string with all escaped characters decoded back to their original form.
3. `escapeUriPath(String value)`: This method takes a string `value` and returns a new string with all characters escaped according to the rules of the `PercentEscaper` class, but only for characters that are not allowed in URI paths.
4. `escapeUriQuery(String value)`: This method takes a string `value` and returns a new string with all characters escaped according to the rules of the `PercentEscaper` class, but only for characters that are not allowed in URI query strings.

The `PercentEscaper` class is used to escape characters that are not allowed in URIs. It takes a set of safe characters as input and escapes all other characters in the string. The `SAFECHARS_URLENCODER` constant is used to specify the set of safe characters for escaping in URIs.

The `URI_ESCAPER`, `URI_PATH_ESCAPER`, and `URI_QUERY_STRING_ESCAPER` constants are used to specify the escaper objects for escaping URIs, URI paths, and URI query strings, respectively. These escaper objects are created using the `PercentEscaper` class with the appropriate set of safe characters.

The `decodeUri(String uri)` method is used to decode a URI string that has been escaped using the `escapeUri(String value)` method. It takes a string `uri` and returns a new string with all escaped characters decoded back to their original form.

The `escapeUriPath(String value)` and `escapeUriQuery(String value)` methods are used to escape a string `value` for use in a URI path or query string, respectively. They return a new string with all characters escaped according to the rules of the `PercentEscaper` class, but only for characters that are not allowed in the corresponding part of the URI.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to escape and unescape characters in URIs, and can be used to ensure that strings are properly encoded and decoded for use in URIs.</s>

This code defines an abstract class called `Escaper` with a single abstract method called `escape`. The `escape` method takes a `String` as input and returns a `String` that has been escaped in some way.

The `Escaper` class is abstract because it does not provide an implementation for the `escape` method. Instead, it leaves it up to the subclass to provide an implementation.

The `Escaper` class is designed to be used as a base class for classes that need to escape strings in a specific way. For example, a subclass of `Escaper` might be used to escape strings for use in a SQL query, or to escape strings for use in a JSON document.

By using an abstract class like `Escaper`, you can define a common interface for escaping strings and then have subclasses provide the specific implementation for each use case. This makes it easier to write code that is flexible and reusable.</s>
