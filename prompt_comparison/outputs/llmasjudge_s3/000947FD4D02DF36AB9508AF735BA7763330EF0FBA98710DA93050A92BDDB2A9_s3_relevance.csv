No, this code does not contain instances of the malware objective known as Execution. The code is a simple Java application that overrides the `onCreate()` method of the `Application` class and logs a message using the `u.i()` method. The `u.i()` method is a logging method that is used to log information to the console, but it does not contain any malicious code that would execute arbitrary code.
