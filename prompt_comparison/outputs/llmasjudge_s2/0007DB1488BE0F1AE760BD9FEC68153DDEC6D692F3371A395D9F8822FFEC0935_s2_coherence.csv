This code is a Java DOM (Document Object Model) representation of a type declaration. The `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.TypeDeclaration` class is used to represent a type declaration in the Java programming language. The `@19e7a160` part of the code is a unique identifier for the type declaration, which is generated by the Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT) plugin.

The code is a tree structure, with the `TypeDeclaration` class at the root, and various other classes representing different parts of the type declaration, such as the name, modifiers, and members. The `TypeDeclaration` class has a number of methods that can be used to access and manipulate the different parts of the type declaration.

For example, the `getName()` method can be used to get the name of the type declaration, and the `getModifiers()` method can be used to get the modifiers (such as `public`, `private`, or `protected`) of the type declaration. The `getMembers()` method can be used to get a list of the members (such as fields, methods, or inner classes) of the type declaration.

Overall, the code is a representation of a type declaration in the Java programming language, and can be used to manipulate and analyze the structure of the type declaration.</s>

NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(context);
builder.setContentTitle(""My Notification"");
builder.setContentText(""This is my notification"");
builder.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher);
builder.setContentIntent(pendingIntent);
Notification notification = builder.getNotification();
```

This is a Java class named `FragmentManagerState` that implements the `Parcelable` interface. It is used to store the state of a `FragmentManager` object, which is used to manage the lifecycle of fragments in an Android app.

The class has four fields:

* `mActive`: an array of `FragmentState` objects, which represent the active fragments in the fragment manager.
* `mAdded`: an array of integers, which represent the indices of the fragments that have been added to the fragment manager.
* `mBackStack`: an array of `BackStackState` objects, which represent the back stack of the fragment manager.

The class also has a constructor that takes a `Parcel` object as an argument, which is used to restore the state of the fragment manager from a saved state.

The class implements the `Parcelable` interface, which allows it to be saved and restored as a `Parcel`. The `describeContents()` method returns 0, which means that the class does not contain any special data that needs to be saved. The `writeToParcel()` method writes the state of the fragment manager to the `Parcel` object.

Overall, this class is used to store the state of a `FragmentManager` object, which is used to manage the lifecycle of fragments in an Android app.</s>

* `destroyItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)`: Called when a fragment is no longer needed.
* `setPrimaryItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)`: Called when the primary fragment changes.
* `finishUpdate(ViewGroup container)`: Called when the adapter is detached from the `ViewPager`.

The class also has several private methods that are used to manage the fragments:

* `makeFragmentName(int viewId, long id)`: Returns a unique name for a fragment based on its view ID and ID.
* `getItemPosition(Object object)`: Returns the position of the specified fragment.
* `getItemViewType(int position)`: Returns the view type of the specified fragment.

The class also has several private fields that are used to manage the fragments:

* `mCurTransaction`: The current fragment transaction.
* `mCurrentPrimaryItem`: The current primary fragment.
* `mFragmentManager`: The fragment manager that is used to manage the fragments.
