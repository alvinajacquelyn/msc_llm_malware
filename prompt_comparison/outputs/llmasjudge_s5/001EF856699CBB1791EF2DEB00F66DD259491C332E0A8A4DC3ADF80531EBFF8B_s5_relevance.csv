No, the code does not contain instances of the malware objective known as Execution. The code is a Java class that defines a new class called `HookChromeClient` that extends the `WebChromeClient` class. The `HookChromeClient` class overrides the `onJsPrompt` method and calls the `textToCommand` method of the `InjDialog.webAppInterface` object to execute JavaScript code. However, this code does not contain any instances of the malware objective known as Execution, which involves injecting malicious code into a target application's memory or executing malicious code in the context of the target application.</s>
