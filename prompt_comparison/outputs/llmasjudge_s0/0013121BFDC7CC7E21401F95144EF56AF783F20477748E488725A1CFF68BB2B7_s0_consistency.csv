This is a generic class named `a` that has a type parameter `D`. It implements an interface named `InterfaceC0000a` with the same type parameter `D`.

The class has several fields and methods:

* `a`: an integer field
* `b`: an instance of `InterfaceC0000a` with the same type parameter `D`
* `c`, `d`, and `e`: boolean fields
* `a(int, InterfaceC0000a<D>)`: a method that takes an integer and an instance of `InterfaceC0000a` and sets the `a` field and the `b` field, respectively. It also checks if there is already a listener registered and throws an exception if so.
* `a(InterfaceC0000a<D>)`: a method that takes an instance of `InterfaceC0000a` and sets the `b` field to the given instance. It also checks if there is already a listener registered and throws an exception if so.
* `a()`: a method that sets the `c` field to `true` and calls the `b()` method.
* `b()`: a protected method that is called by the `a()` method.
* `c()`: a method that sets the `c` field to `false` and calls the `d()` method.
* `d()`: a protected method that is called by the `c()` method.
* `e()`: a method that sets the `e` field to `true`, sets the `c` field to `false`, sets the `d` field to `false`, and sets the `f` field to `false`. It also calls the `f()` method.
* `f()`: a protected method that is called by the `e()` method.
* `a(D)`: a method that takes an instance of `D` and returns a string representation of the object.
* `toString()`: a method that returns a string representation of the object.
* `a(String, FileDescriptor, PrintWriter, String[])`: a method that takes a string, a file descriptor, a print writer, and an array of strings and prints the object's fields and methods to the print writer.

The class is generic, meaning that it can be used with different types of data. The `D` type parameter is used to specify the type of data that the class can handle.</s>

This code is a part of the Android Support Library, specifically the v4 library. It defines a class called `LoaderInfo` that is used to manage the state of a `Loader` object.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class `LoaderInfo` has several fields, including `mId`, `mArgs`, `mCallbacks`, `mLoader`, `mHaveData`, `mDeliveredData`, `mData`, `mStarted`, `mReportNextStart`, `mDestroyed`, `mRetaining`, `mRetainingStarted`, `mListenerRegistered`, and `mPendingLoader`.
2. The constructor of `LoaderInfo` takes two arguments: `id` and `args`. The `id` is an integer that uniquely identifies the loader, and the `args` is a `Bundle` that contains any arguments that were passed to the loader.
3. The `a()` method is called when the loader is started. It sets the `mStarted` field to `true` and calls the `a()` method of the `mCallbacks` field, which is an instance of the `LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks` interface.
4. The `b()` method is called when the loader is retained. It sets the `mRetaining` field to `true` and calls the `b()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
5. The `c()` method is called when the loader is finished. It sets the `mRetaining` field to `false` and calls the `c()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
6. The `d()` method is called when the loader is destroyed. It sets the `mDestroyed` field to `true` and calls the `d()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
7. The `e()` method is called when the loader is reset. It sets the `mHaveData` field to `false` and calls the `e()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
8. The `a(android.support.v4.a.a<Object> aVar, Object obj)` method is called when the loader has finished loading data. It sets the `mHaveData` field to `true` and calls the `a()` method of the `mCallbacks` field, passing in the `aVar` and `obj` arguments.

Overall, this class is used to manage the state of a `Loader` object and to communicate with the `LoaderManager` that created it.</s>

This code defines a custom `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class that extends the Android `FrameLayout` class. The class is designed to prevent the view hierarchy from saving the state of the views in the layout.

The `a` method is a static factory method that creates a new `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` instance and adds the given `view` to it. The method sets the layout parameters of the `view` to `FrameLayout.LayoutParams(-1, -1)`, which means that the view will not be saved in the layout state.

The `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class overrides the `dispatchSaveInstanceState` and `dispatchRestoreInstanceState` methods to prevent the view hierarchy from saving and restoring the state of the views in the layout. Instead, the `dispatchFreezeSelfOnly` and `dispatchThawSelfOnly` methods are called, which do not save or restore the state of the views.

The `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class is used to create a new layout that does not save the state of the views in it. This can be useful when you want to create a layout that does not save the state of its views, such as a layout that contains a view that is not intended to be saved.</s>

This code defines a class called `SavedState` that implements the `Parcelable` interface. The class has a single constructor that takes a `Parcel` object and a `ClassLoader` object as parameters. The constructor reads the contents of the `Parcel` object and stores them in a `Bundle` object called `a`. If the `ClassLoader` object is not null, it sets the class loader of the `Bundle` object to the `ClassLoader` object.

The `SavedState` class also defines a static `CREATOR` field that is an instance of a `Parcelable.Creator` class. The `CREATOR` field has two methods: `createFromParcel` and `newArray`. The `createFromParcel` method creates a new instance of the `SavedState` class by reading the contents of the `Parcel` object passed to it. The `newArray` method creates an array of `SavedState` objects.

The `SavedState` class also defines two methods: `describeContents` and `writeToParcel`. The `describeContents` method returns 0, indicating that the class does not contain any special contents that need to be saved. The `writeToParcel` method writes the contents of the `Bundle` object called `a` to the `Parcel` object passed to it.

In summary, the `SavedState` class is a helper class that is used to save the state of a `Parcelable` object. It reads the contents of a `Parcel` object and stores them in a `Bundle` object, and it provides a way to create new instances of the `SavedState` class from a `Parcel` object.</s>

This code defines a method called `a` that takes two parameters: `obj` and `sb`. The method is defined as static, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

The method first checks if `obj` is null. If it is, it appends the string ""null"" to the `sb` parameter and returns.

If `obj` is not null, the method gets the simple name of the class of `obj` using the `getClass()` method. If the simple name is null or empty, it gets the full class name of `obj` using the `getName()` method and extracts the simple name by removing everything before the last dot (`.`) character.

The method then appends the simple name to the `sb` parameter and appends an opening curly brace (`{`) to indicate the start of the object's properties.

Finally, the method appends the object's hash code to the `sb` parameter using the `Integer.toHexString()` method and returns.

This method is used to create a string representation of an object, which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.</s>

This code defines a custom `Writer` class called `b` that extends the `Writer` class in Java. The class has a private field called `a` of type `String`, and a private field called `b` of type `StringBuilder`. The constructor takes a `String` parameter called `str` and assigns it to the `a` field.

The `close()`, `flush()`, and `write()` methods are overridden to perform specific actions. The `close()` method calls the `a()` method, which deletes the contents of the `b` field. The `flush()` method also calls the `a()` method.

The `write()` method takes a `char[]` parameter called `cArr`, an `int` parameter called `i`, and an `int` parameter called `i2`. It iterates over the characters in the `cArr` array, starting at index `i`, and appends each character to the `b` field. If the character is a newline (`\n`), it calls the `a()` method. Otherwise, it appends the character to the `b` field.

The `a()` method deletes the contents of the `b` field and logs the contents of the `b` field to the Android log.

Overall, this code defines a custom `Writer` class that can be used to write characters to a `StringBuilder` and log the contents of the `StringBuilder` to the Android log.</s>

This is a Java class that implements a map data structure called a ""hash table"". A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It is called a ""hash table"" because it uses a hash function to ""hash"" the keys, which is a way of converting them into a numerical index that can be used to access the corresponding value in the table.

The class is generic, meaning that it can be used to store values of any type. The type of the values is specified by the type parameter ""E"".

The class has several methods:

* `a(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns `null`.
* `a(int i, E e)`: Associates the value `e` with the key `i`. If there is already a value associated with `i`, returns the old value.
* `b(int i)`: Removes the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `c(int i)`: Removes all values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `d(int i)`: Returns the number of values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns 0.
* `a()`: Returns the total number of values in the map.
* `e(int i)`: Returns the key associated with the value at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns -1.
* `f(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns `null`.
* `b()`: Removes all values from the map.

The class also has several private methods:

* `c()`: Resizes the map by doubling the size of the arrays used to store the keys and values.
* `a(int i, E e)`: Associates the value `e` with the key `i`. If there is already a value associated with `i`, returns the old value.
* `b(int i)`: Removes the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `c(int i)`: Removes all values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `d(int i)`: Returns the number of values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns 0.
* `a()`: Returns the total number of values in the map.
* `e(int i)`: Returns the key associated with the value at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns -1.
* `f(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns `null`.
* `b()`: Removes all values from the map.

The class also has several private fields:

* `a`: A constant object used to represent the absence of a value.
* `b`: A boolean indicating whether the map needs to be resized.
* `c`: An array of integers used to store the keys.
* `d`: An array of objects used to store the values.
* `e`: The number of values in the map.

The class also has several static methods:

* `g(int i)`: Returns the next power of 2 greater than or equal to `i`.
* `h(int i)`: Returns the number of elements that can be stored in a hash table with a load factor of 0.75 and a size of `i`.</s>

This code is a Java class that extends the `android.support.v4.view.a` class, which is a support library class for accessing features in the Android framework that are only available on API level 4 and higher.

The class is named `c`, which is a common convention for anonymous inner classes in Java. The class is defined as a static nested class of the `ViewPager` class, which is a custom view that allows users to swipe between pages of content.

The `c` class overrides several methods of the `android.support.v4.view.a` class, which are used to provide accessibility support for the `ViewPager` view. The overridden methods include:

* `d(View, AccessibilityEvent)`: This method is called when the accessibility event is dispatched to the `ViewPager` view. It sets the class name of the event to `ViewPager`.
* `a(View, android.support.v4.view.a.a)`: This method is called when the accessibility delegate is initialized for the `ViewPager` view. It sets the class name of the event to `ViewPager` and also sets the `ViewPager` view's accessibility information.

The `c` class also defines a nested interface named `c`, which is used to provide accessibility support for the `ViewPager` view. The `c` interface includes several methods that are used to provide accessibility information about the `ViewPager` view, such as the number of pages and the current page.

Overall, this code is a custom accessibility delegate for the `ViewPager` view that provides accessibility support for the view on devices with API level 4 and higher.</s>
