No, this code is not malicious. It appears to be a custom implementation of a BroadcastReceiver that is designed to intercept and modify incoming broadcast intents. The code uses a custom class loader to load a class with the same name as the receiver, and then creates an instance of that class to call its `onReceive()` method. The code also uses a custom method called `ACall.getACall().c1()` and `ACall.getACall().c2()` to call additional methods before and after the `onReceive()` method is called.

However, it is important to note that this code is not a standard Android BroadcastReceiver, and it may not work as expected on all devices or in all situations. Additionally, the use of a custom class loader and the creation of a new instance of a class with the same name as the receiver may be considered a security risk, as it could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the app. Therefore, it is recommended to use this code with caution and to thoroughly test it before deploying it in a production environment.</s>
