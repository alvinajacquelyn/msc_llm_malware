No, this code is not malicious. It appears to be a Java class that extends the `cn` class and overrides several methods. The `a` method is called with a `m` and `String` parameter, and it checks if the `m` parameter is `PURCHASED` and the `String` parameter is ""disable_ad"". If both conditions are true, it calls the `a` method of the `Settings` class. The `a` method is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it's not possible to determine what it does.

The `a` method is also called with a `n` parameter, and it checks if the `n` parameter is not `RESULT_OK`. If it's not, it sets the `n` parameter to `RESULT_USER_CANCELED`.

The `a` method is also called with a `boolean` parameter, and it checks if the `boolean` parameter is true. If it is, it calls the `b` method of the `Settings` class. If it's not, it calls the `showDialog` method of the `Settings` class with the parameter `2`.
