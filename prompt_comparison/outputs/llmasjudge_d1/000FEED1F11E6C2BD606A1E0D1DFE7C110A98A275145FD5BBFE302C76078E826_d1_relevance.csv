Yes, the code contains instances of Execution.

The `SearchViewCompat` class contains a static field `IMPL` that is initialized to an instance of `SearchViewCompatImpl` based on the Android version. The `SearchViewCompatImpl` interface defines the methods that are used to create a `SearchView` and set a listener for query text changes.

The `SearchViewCompatHoneycombImpl` class is a concrete implementation of `SearchViewCompatImpl` that is used for Android versions 11 and higher. This class creates a `SearchView` using the `SearchViewCompatHoneycomb.newSearchView()` method and sets a listener for query text changes using the `SearchViewCompatHoneycomb.setOnQueryTextListener()` method.

The `SearchViewCompatStubImpl` class is another concrete implementation of `SearchViewCompatImpl` that is used for Android versions lower than 11. This class creates a `SearchView` using the `SearchViewCompatStub.newSearchView()` method and sets a listener for query text changes using the `SearchViewCompatStub.setOnQueryTextListener()` method.

In summary, the code contains instances of Execution because it uses the `SearchViewCompat` class to create a `SearchView` and set a listener for query text changes, and it uses the `SearchViewCompatHoneycombImpl` and `SearchViewCompatStubImpl` classes to provide different implementations of the `SearchViewCompatImpl` interface based on the Android version.</s>
