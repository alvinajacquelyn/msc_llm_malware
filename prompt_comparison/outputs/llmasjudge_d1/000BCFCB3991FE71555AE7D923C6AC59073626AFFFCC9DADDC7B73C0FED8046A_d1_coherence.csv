This code is a part of the Android operating system, specifically in the `C0005e` class. It is a utility class that provides methods for encoding and decoding Base64 strings.

The `a` method takes a byte array and a boolean flag as input, and returns a Base64-encoded string. The `b` method takes a Base64-encoded string and returns a byte array.

The `a` method is implemented using a static initializer block, which initializes the `b` and `c` arrays. The `b` array is a mapping from ASCII characters to their corresponding Base64 values, while the `c` array is a mapping from Base64 values to their corresponding ASCII characters.

The `a` method first converts the input byte array to a Base64-encoded string by calling the `b` method. It then returns the resulting string.

The `b` method is implemented using a loop that iterates over the input byte array and converts each byte to its corresponding Base64 value. It then returns the resulting array of Base64 values.

The `b` method first converts the input byte array to a string using the `String` constructor. It then iterates over the characters in the string and converts each character to its corresponding Base64 value using the `b` array. It then returns the resulting array of Base64 values.

The `b` method also includes a check for the length of the input byte array, which ensures that the resulting Base64-encoded string is properly padded with `=` characters if necessary.

This code defines a custom `WebViewClient` class named `G` that extends the `WebViewClient` class. The class has a private field named `a` of type `WA`, which is a custom class that is not defined in this code snippet.

The `G` class has two constructors: one that takes a `WA` object as a parameter and another that takes no parameters. The `onPageStarted` method is overridden to call the `super.onPageStarted` method and then do nothing else.

The `onReceivedError` method is also overridden. It first checks if the error message starts with ""http://"" and if not, it returns without doing anything. If the error message starts with ""http://"", it loads a custom error message into the web view using the `loadData` method and then sets the `b` field of the `WA` object to `true`.

The `WA` class is not defined in this code snippet, so it is not possible to know what it does or what its fields are. However, based on the name, it seems to be a custom class that is used to manage the web view.</s>

This code defines a class named `H` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The `H` class has a single constructor that takes a `WA` object as a parameter. The `run()` method of the `Runnable` interface is implemented in the `H` class, and it calls the `finish()` method of the `WA` object that was passed to the constructor.

The `WA` class is not defined in this code snippet, but it is likely to be a class that represents a work assignment, and the `finish()` method is likely to be a method that marks the work assignment as complete.

The `final` keyword before the `class` keyword indicates that the class is final, which means that it cannot be extended or subclassed. The `private` keyword before the `WA a` field indicates that the field is private, which means that it can only be accessed from within the `H` class.

Overall, this code defines a simple class that can be used to mark a work assignment as complete when it is finished.</s>

This code defines a class named `n` that provides a method for generating a file path based on a given string. The method takes two string parameters: `context` and `str`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class is defined as `public final`, which means it cannot be extended or subclassed.
2. The class has a private static field named `a` that is initialized to `null`.
3. The class has a static method named `a()` that returns an instance of the class. If the `a` field is `null`, a new instance is created and stored in the `a` field.
4. The class has a static method named `a(Context context, String str, String str2)` that takes three string parameters: `context`, `str`, and `str2`.
5. The method first calls the `a()` method to ensure that the `a` field is initialized.
6. The method then replaces all non-word, non-period, and non-hyphen characters in `str2` with an empty string using the `replaceAll()` method.
7. The method then checks if the external storage is mounted using the `b()` method. If it is not mounted, the method returns `null`.
8. If the external storage is mounted, the method creates a new `StringBuffer` object and appends the external storage directory to it.
9. The method then checks if the directory exists. If it does not exist, the method creates the directory using the `mkdirs()` method.
10. The method then returns the file path as a string by concatenating the `StringBuffer` object with the `replaceAll()` result.
11. The method then checks if the `str` parameter is not empty. If it is not, the method creates a new `StringBuffer` object and appends the `str` parameter to it.
12. The method then checks if the directory exists. If it does not exist, the method creates the directory using the `mkdirs()` method.
13. The method then returns the file path as a string by concatenating the `StringBuffer` object with the `replaceAll()` result.
14. The method then checks if the `str` parameter is empty. If it is, the method returns `null`.

In summary, the `n` class provides a method for generating a file path based on a given string. The method first checks if the external storage is mounted, and if it is, it creates a new directory based on the `str` parameter. If the `str` parameter is empty, the method returns `null`.</s>

This is a Java class that represents a notification manager for an Android app. It provides methods for sending notifications to the user, such as `a(int, int, String, String, String, Intent, int, String, long)` which takes a notification ID, a resource ID for the notification icon, a title, a text message, a ticker text, an intent to launch when the notification is clicked, a flag for the notification type, and a timestamp.

The class has a private constructor that takes a `Context` object and initializes the `NotificationManager` object. It also has a private field `a` which is an `ImageView` object that represents the notification icon.

The `a(int, int, String, String, String, Intent, int, String, long)` method creates a new `Notification` object and sets its properties, including the icon, ticker text, and timestamp. It then uses the `setLatestEventInfo()` method to set the notification content and the `PendingIntent` object to launch the intent when the notification is clicked.

The `a(int)` method cancels the notification with the given ID.

The `a(Context)` method is a static method that returns an instance of the `r` class, creating it if necessary. It takes a `Context` object as a parameter and uses it to create the `NotificationManager` object.

The `a(int, int, String, String, String, Intent, int, String, long)` method is the main method of the class and is used to send a notification to the user. It takes a notification ID, a resource ID for the notification icon, a title, a text message, a ticker text, an intent to launch when the notification is clicked, a flag for the notification type, and a timestamp as parameters.

This code defines a class called `RunnableC0011k` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has a private field called `a` of type `C0010j`, which is not shown in the code snippet.

The `RunnableC0011k` class has a constructor that takes a `C0010j` object as a parameter. The constructor initializes the `a` field with the passed-in `C0010j` object.

The `run()` method of the `RunnableC0011k` class is annotated with the `@Override` annotation, which means that it overrides the `run()` method of the `Runnable` interface. The method body consists of several lines of code that are not shown in the code snippet.

The first line of the method body, `C0007g c0007g;`, declares a variable called `c0007g` of type `C0007g`, which is not shown in the code snippet. The second line of the method body, `c0007g=this.a.h;`, assigns the value of the `h` field of the `a` field to the `c0007g` variable.

The third line of the method body, `r.a(c0007g.d).a(this.a.b.e() + 12345,R.drawable.ic_menu_share,this.a.b.a(),this.a.b.a(),""å¼€å§‹ä¸‹è½½ "",new Intent(),32,this.a.b.b(),this.a.d);`, calls the `a()` method of the `r` class, passing in the `d` field of the `c0007g` variable as an argument. The `a()` method returns a new instance of the `r` class, which is then called with the `a()` method again, passing in several arguments. The first argument is the result of adding 12345 to the `e()` method of the `b` field of the `a` field. The second argument is a drawable resource ID, which is not shown in the code snippet. The third argument is the result of calling the `a()` method of the `b` field of the `a` field. The fourth argument is the result of calling the `a()` method of the `b` field of the `a` field. The fifth argument is a string, which is not shown in the code snippet. The sixth argument is an `Intent` object, which is not shown in the code snippet. The seventh argument is an integer, which is not shown in the code snippet. The eighth argument is the result of calling the `b()` method of the `b` field of the `a` field. The ninth argument is the result of calling the `d()` method of the `a` field. The tenth argument is the result of calling the `d()` method of the `a` field.

Overall, this code appears to be defining a class that implements the `Runnable` interface and has a constructor that takes a `C0010j` object as a parameter. The `run()` method of the class appears to be calling the `a()` method of the `r` class, passing in several arguments. The purpose of the code is not clear from the code snippet alone.</s>

This code defines a class named `t` that has a single static method named `a`. The method takes two parameters: `context` of type `Context` and `z` of type `boolean`.

The method first checks if the `a` field is null. If it is, it initializes it with a new instance of the `t` class.

Next, the method creates a `StringBuffer` object and appends the package names of all installed packages to it. The package names are obtained from the `getInstalledPackages()` method of the `PackageManager` class, which returns a list of `PackageInfo` objects representing the installed packages.

The method then returns the `StringBuffer` object as a string. The string is obtained by calling the `toString()` method on the `StringBuffer` object and then removing the first character (which is a comma).

The `t` class is marked as `final`, which means that it cannot be extended or subclassed. The `a` field is also marked as `private`, which means that it can only be accessed within the `t` class.</s>

It has several private fields, including a `Handler` for handling asynchronous tasks, a `ConcurrentHashMap` for storing the downloaded images, an `ExecutorService` for running the download tasks, and another `ConcurrentHashMap` for storing the downloaded images in a compressed format.
2. The `a` method is the entry point for the image download and caching process. It takes a `Context` object, a `String` representing the URL of the image to download, and a `y` object representing the image format. It first checks if the image has already been downloaded and cached, and if so, returns the cached image. Otherwise, it creates a new `HttpURLConnection` object and sets the connection timeout and read timeout to 5 seconds. It then reads the input stream of the connection and writes it to a temporary file. Finally, it renames the temporary file to the actual file name and returns the downloaded image.
3. The `b` method is a static method that creates a new instance of the `v` class and returns it.

This code defines a custom `Handler` class named `w` that extends the Android `Handler` class. The `w` class has a private field named `a` of type `v`, which is a custom class that extends the Android `Handler` class.

The `w` class has a constructor that takes a `v` object as a parameter and assigns it to the `a` field.

The `handleMessage` method is overridden to handle messages of type `Message`. The method checks if the message object is null, and if not, it casts the message object to an array of objects. The first object in the array is a `String` representing the image URL, and the second object is a `Bitmap` representing the image.

If the `Bitmap` object is not null, the method creates a new `WeakReference` object and adds it to a `ConcurrentHashMap` object named `concurrentHashMap2`. The `ConcurrentHashMap` object is a map that stores weak references to the `Bitmap` objects.

The method then creates a new `BitmapDrawable` object and adds it to a `ConcurrentHashMap` object named `concurrentHashMap`. The `ConcurrentHashMap` object is a map that stores the `BitmapDrawable` objects.

Finally, the method removes the `Queue` object associated with the image URL from the `ConcurrentHashMap` object named `concurrentHashMap`. The `Queue` object is a queue of `Bitmap` objects that are waiting to be processed.

1. The first line imports the necessary packages: `android.app`, `android.os`, `android.util`, `android.view`, `android.webkit`, and `android.widget`.
2. The next line defines a class called `WA` that extends the `Activity` class.
3. Inside the `WA` class, there are several private variables and methods defined. The `a` variable is a `WebView` object, and the `c` variable is a `TextView` object. The `b` variable is a `boolean` that is used to determine whether the app is in debug mode. The `d` variable is a `Map` that is used to store information about installed apps.
4. The `a()` method is called when the app is created. It retrieves a list of installed packages and stores their package names in the `d` map.
5. The `a(WA, String)` method is a JavaScript interface that allows the web page to set the text of the `c` TextView.
6. The `back()` method is a JavaScript interface that allows the web page to go back to the previous page.
7. The `checkInstall(String, String)` method is a JavaScript interface that checks whether an app is installed, downloaded, or being downloaded.
8. The `debug(String)` method is a JavaScript interface that logs a message to the Android log.
9. The `downloadApp(int, String, String, String, String)` method is a JavaScript interface that downloads an app.
10. The `installApp(int, String, String, String, String)` method is a JavaScript interface that installs an app.
11. The `onBackPressed()` method is called when the user presses the back button. If the app is in debug mode or the WebView can go back, it will go back. Otherwise, it will call the superclass's `onBackPressed()` method.

The method first retrieves the display metrics of the device using the `getResources()` method of the `Context` object. It then multiplies the density of the device by 6.0f and adds 0.5f to the result. The result is then cast to an `int` value.

The method is marked as `public final`, which means it is public and cannot be overridden. It is also marked as `static`, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

The method returns the calculated value as an `int` value.</s>

This code defines a class named `a` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has a single constructor that takes an `AdBanner` object as a parameter. The `run()` method is not implemented, and instead throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` with the message ""Method not decompiled"".

The `AdBanner` class is not defined in this code snippet, so it is not possible to determine the purpose of the `a` class without more context. However, based on the name of the class and the method it implements, it is likely that this class is used to display an advertisement banner in a mobile app. The `AdBanner` object passed to the constructor is likely the banner that needs to be displayed.</s>

This code is a part of an Android app that receives broadcasts from the Android system when a new app is installed or when the device's network connectivity changes.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `AdReceiver` class extends `BroadcastReceiver` and has a `Handler` object called `a` that is used to post a `p` object to the message queue after a delay.
2. The `onReceive` method is called when the app receives a broadcast. It checks the action of the broadcast and if it's not ""android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED"", it returns.
3. If the action is ""android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE"", it checks if the device has an active network connection and if so, it calls the `a` method with the `context` and `intent` parameters.
4. The `a` method gets the shared preferences for the app and iterates through the keys in the preferences. For each key, it gets the value and checks if it's a `com.feiwoone.banner.c.b` object. If it is, it calls the `a` method with the `context` and `bVar` parameters.
5. The `a` method gets the app key and install count from the shared preferences and checks if the install count is greater than 0. If it is, it starts an activity for the package name in the intent data.
6. If the install count is 0 or the time since the last install is greater than 30 minutes, it sets the install count to 0.
7. The `a` method gets the JSON object for the app from the shared preferences and checks if it's null. If it's not null, it gets the install count and time from the JSON object and sets the install count to 0 if the time is greater than 30 minutes.
8. The `a` method posts a `p` object to the message queue with the `context`, `schemeSpecificPart`, `str`, and `b` parameters.

The `p` class is a private class that extends `Runnable` and has a `run` method that gets the app key and install count from the shared preferences, checks if the install count is greater than 0, and if so, starts an activity for the package name in the intent data.</s>

This code is a part of a Java class that extends the `Handler` class. It is used to handle messages sent to the handler.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class is defined as `public final class c extends Handler`. This means that it is a final class that extends the `Handler` class.
2. The class has a private field called `a` of type `b`. This is likely a reference to another object of type `b`.
3. The class has a constructor that takes a `b` object as a parameter. This constructor sets the `a` field to the passed-in `b` object.
4. The class overrides the `handleMessage` method of the `Handler` class. This method is called when a message is sent to the handler.
5. The method checks the `what` field of the `Message` object to determine what action to take.
6. If the `what` field is 0, the method checks if the `textView` field is not null. If it is not null, it checks if the `aVar` field is not null. If it is not null, it checks if the `aVar2` field is not null. If it is not null, it checks if the `aVar3` field is not null. If it is not null, it checks if the `aVar4` field is not null. If it is not null, it checks if the `e` field of the `aVar4` object is not null. If it is not null, it sets the text of the `textView` object to the first element of the `e` field.
7. If the `what` field is 1, the method checks if the `b.d(this.a)` method returns a non-null value. If it does, it calls the `a()` method on the returned value.
8. If the `what` field is 100, the method creates a new `Intent` object with the action `android.intent.action.VIEW` and the data `parse`. It then adds the flag `1` to the intent. Finally, it starts the activity with the intent.

In summary, this code is handling messages sent to the handler and performing various actions based on the `what` field of the message.</s>

This code is a listener for a button click event. It is defined as an anonymous inner class, which means it is defined within the scope of another class. The class it is defined in is called `d`, and it implements the `View.OnClickListener` interface.

The `d` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `b` and `Intent`. `b` is an instance of the `b` class, which is a subclass of `View`. `Intent` is an instance of the `Intent` class, which is used to represent an intent to perform an action.

The `onClick` method is the method that is called when the button is clicked. It has a `View` parameter called `view`, which is the button that was clicked.

The method first retrieves the `b` instance that was passed to the constructor, and then retrieves the `Intent` instance that was passed to the constructor. It then uses the `a` method of the `b` instance to retrieve the `a` instance that contains the ad information.

The method then uses a switch statement to determine the type of ad that was clicked. Depending on the type of ad, it will perform different actions. For example, if the ad is a web ad, it will start a new activity with the URL of the ad. If the ad is a native ad, it will display the ad in a new activity.

* `AdReceiver`
* `Context`
* `String`
* `String`
* `JSONObject`

The class has a private field for each of these parameters, and it initializes them in the constructor.

The `run()` method is the entry point for the thread. It first calls the `a()` method on the `AdReceiver` object, passing in the `Context`, `String`, and `JSONObject` parameters. It then creates a new instance of the `m` class, which is a nested class within the `e` class. It then creates a new instance of the `o` class, which is also a nested class within the `e` class. It then calls the `a()` method on the `o` object, passing in the `Context`, `String`, and `JSONObject` parameters.

Finally, it calls the `a()` method on the `m` object, passing in the `o` object. This method is responsible for sending the ad request to the ad server.

The `a()` method on the `AdReceiver` object is responsible for removing the callback from the `Handler` object. This is done by calling the `removeCallbacks()` method on the `Handler` object, passing in the `Runnable` object that was passed to the `postDelayed()` method.

Overall, this code appears to be responsible for sending an ad request to an ad server, and then removing the callback from the `Handler` object after the ad request has been sent.</s>

Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The `i` class contains a static method `a` that creates a new instance of the `i` class if it doesn't already exist. This is an example of Execution, as it allows the code to create a new instance of itself. Additionally, the `a` method uses a loop to iterate over a list of installed packages and performs various operations on each package, such as checking its flags and appending its package name to a string buffer. These operations are all examples of Execution.</s>
