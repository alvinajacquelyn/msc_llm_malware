Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The method `a()` creates a new `File` object and uses the `File` class's `exists()` method to check if the file exists. If the file does not exist, the method returns `null`. If the file exists, the method uses the `File` class's `mkdirs()` method to create the directory if it does not exist.

The method `b()` checks if the external storage is mounted by using the `Environment.getExternalStorageState()` method. If the external storage is not mounted, the method returns `false`.

The method `a(String str)` reads the contents of the file and checks if the string `str` is present in the file. If the string is not present, the method returns `false`. If the string is present, the method returns `true`.

The method `b(String str)` writes the string `str` to the file, followed by the current timestamp. The method uses the `FileOutputStream` class to write to the file, and the `BufferedWriter` class to write the string to the file. The method then closes the `FileOutputStream` and `BufferedWriter` objects.

Overall, the code contains instances of Execution, as it creates and manipulates files and directories, and reads and writes data to and from files.</s>

Yes, the code contains instances of Execution.

Yes, this code contains instances of Execution. The `a()` method contains a series of instructions that execute code on the system, including:

* Assigning the result of `this.a.h` to the `f63c` field of the `com.buyang.redt.e.a` object.
