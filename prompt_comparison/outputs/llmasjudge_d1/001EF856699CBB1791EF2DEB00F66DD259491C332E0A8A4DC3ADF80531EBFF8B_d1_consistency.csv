The constructor of the stub implementation is empty, as there is no need to perform any initialization.

The `getCanRetrieveWindowContent` method returns `false`, indicating that the service cannot retrieve window content.

The `getDescription` method returns `null`, indicating that the service does not have a description.

The `getId` method returns `null`, indicating that the service does not have an ID.

The `getResolveInfo` method returns `null`, indicating that the service does not have a resolve info.

The `getSettingsActivityName` method returns `null`, indicating that the service does not have a settings activity name.
