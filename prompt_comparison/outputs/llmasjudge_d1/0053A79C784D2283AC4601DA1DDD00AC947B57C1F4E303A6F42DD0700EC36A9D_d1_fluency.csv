Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a class named `TimeUtils` that contains several methods for formatting durations. These methods use the `formatDurationLocked` method to perform the actual formatting, which is where the Execution behavior is implemented. The `formatDurationLocked` method uses a loop to iterate over the duration fields (days, hours, minutes, and seconds) and appends the formatted values to a `char[]` array. The `formatDurationLocked` method also uses the `accumField` and `printField` methods to perform the actual formatting, which are where the Execution behavior is implemented.</s>
