No, the code does not contain instances of Execution. The code is a Java class that implements a sparse array data structure, which is used to store key-value pairs in a way that is optimized for memory usage. The class contains methods for adding, removing, and retrieving elements from the array, as well as methods for iterating over the elements in the array. However, the code does not contain any instances of Execution, which is a type of malware that is designed to execute code on a system to achieve a variety of goals.</s>

Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a class called `TimeUtils` that contains methods for formatting durations. The `formatDuration` method takes a duration as an argument and returns a formatted string representation of the duration. The method uses a series of `if` statements to determine the appropriate format for the duration, based on the length of the duration and the desired field length. The method also uses a series of `for` loops to iterate over the duration and append the appropriate characters to the formatted string. Overall, the code contains instances of Execution, as it uses the `if` and `for` statements to execute code based on the values of variables and the results of operations.</s>
