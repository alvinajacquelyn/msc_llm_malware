No, this code does not contain instances of Execution. The code defines a custom class loader that overrides the `loadClass` method to load classes from a custom class path.

Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The method `di(Context context, int i)` is a native method that is defined in the `u` class and is marked as `native`.

The method is called with the `System.loadLibrary(""ni"")` statement, which loads a native library called ""ni"" and makes its methods available for use in the Java code.
