Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a class called `TimeUtils` that contains methods for formatting durations. The `formatDuration` method takes a duration as an argument and returns a formatted string representation of the duration. The method uses a series of `if` statements to determine the appropriate format for the duration, based on the length of the duration and the desired field length. The method also uses a series of `for` loops to iterate over the duration and append the appropriate characters to the formatted string. Overall, the code contains instances of Execution, as it uses the `if` and `for` statements to execute code based on the values of variables and the results of operations.</s>

These methods are used to set and retrieve the action view, expand and collapse the action view, and set a listener for when the action view is expanded or collapsed.

The code also defines a set of constants for the different actions that can be performed on a menu item, such as `SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS`, `SHOW_AS_ACTION_COLLAPSE_ACTION_VIEW`, `SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM`, `SHOW_AS_ACTION_NEVER`, and `SHOW_AS_ACTION_WITH_TEXT`.

The code also defines a set of interfaces for the different versions of the `MenuItemCompat` class, such as `BaseMenuVersionImpl`, `HoneycombMenuVersionImpl`, and `IcsMenuVersionImpl`. These interfaces define the methods that are available in each version of the class.
