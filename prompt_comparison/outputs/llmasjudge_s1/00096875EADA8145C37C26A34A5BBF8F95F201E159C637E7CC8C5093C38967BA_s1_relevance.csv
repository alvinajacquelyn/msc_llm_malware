No, this code does not contain instances of the malware objective known as Execution. The code is a Java class that implements a listener for a specific event, and it does not contain any code that could be used to execute malicious code. The only method that is defined in the class is the `toString()` method, which is used to convert the object to a string representation. The class does not contain any code that could be used to execute malicious code, and it does not contain any references to external libraries or resources that could be used to execute malicious code.
