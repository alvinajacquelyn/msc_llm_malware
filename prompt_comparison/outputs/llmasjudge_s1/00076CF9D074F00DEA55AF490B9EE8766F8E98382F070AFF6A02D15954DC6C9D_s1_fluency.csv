Yes, this code contains instances of the malware objective known as Execution. The code defines a class named `Score` that has a method named `submitTo` that takes a `Leaderboard` object and a `SubmitToCB` callback as arguments. The method then submits the score to the leaderboard and calls the callback with a boolean parameter indicating whether the submission was successful.

The `submitTo` method also contains a number of other malicious code patterns, including:

1. Unvalidated user input: The method takes a `Leaderboard` object as an argument, which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. If an attacker can craft a malicious `Leaderboard` object, they could potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's device.
2. Blob injection: The method also contains code that uploads a blob to the server, which could potentially be used to inject malware or steal sensitive data.
3. Resource property injection: The method also sets a number of resource properties, which could potentially be used to inject malware or steal sensitive data.

Overall, this code contains a number of potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's device.</s>
