[Start summary]
This code defines a class called `ActivityCompat` that extends `ContextCompat`. It contains several static methods that provide compatibility functionality for activities.

Here's a breakdown of the methods:

* `invalidateOptionsMenu(Activity activity)`: This method is used to invalidate the options menu for the given activity. It returns `true` if the method is supported on the current platform, and `false` otherwise.
* `startActivity(Activity activity, Intent intent, Bundle options)`: This method is used to start an activity with the given intent and options. If the current platform is Android 4.0 (API level 14) or higher, it uses the `ActivityCompatJB.startActivity()` method to start the activity. Otherwise, it uses the `activity.startActivity()` method.
* `startActivityForResult(Activity activity, Intent intent, int requestCode, Bundle options)`: This method is used to start an activity for a result with the given intent, request code, and options. If the current platform is Android 4.0 (API level 14) or higher, it uses the `ActivityCompatJB.startActivityForResult()` method to start the activity. Otherwise, it uses the `activity.startActivityForResult()` method.
* `finishAffinity(Activity activity)`: This method is used to finish the activity and all of its related activities. If the current platform is Android 4.1 (API level 16) or higher, it uses the `ActivityCompatJB.finishAffinity()` method to finish the activity. Otherwise, it uses the `activity.finish()` method.

Overall, this class provides a way to use the new `ActivityCompat` methods on older platforms, while still using the newer methods on newer platforms.</s>

[Start summary]
This code defines a class called `ActivityCompatHoneycomb` that is a subclass of the `Activity` class. The class has a constructor that takes no arguments and a static method called `invalidateOptionsMenu` that takes an `Activity` object as an argument. The method calls the `invalidateOptionsMenu` method on the `Activity` object, which is a method that is only available on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) and later versions of the platform.

The class also has a static method called `dump` that takes an `Activity` object, a prefix, a file descriptor, a print writer, and an array of strings as arguments. The method calls the `dump` method on the `Activity` object, which is a method that is only available on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) and later versions of the platform.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to call the `invalidateOptionsMenu` and `dump` methods on an `Activity` object, even if the `Activity` object is not an instance of the `Activity` class. This is useful because the `Activity` class is not available on earlier versions of the platform, so the methods need to be provided as a way to call these methods on an `Activity` object even if the `Activity` object is not an instance of the `Activity` class.</s>

[Start summary]
This code defines a class called `ActivityCompatJB` that provides a compatibility layer for starting activities and finishing activities in Android.

The class has three static methods:

1. `startActivity(Context context, Intent intent, Bundle options)`: This method starts an activity using the `startActivity()` method of the `Context` class. It takes three parameters:
	* `context`: The context of the activity.
	* `intent`: The intent that describes the activity to start.
	* `options`: The options for the activity.
2. `startActivityForResult(Activity activity, Intent intent, int requestCode, Bundle options)`: This method starts an activity using the `startActivityForResult()` method of the `Activity` class. It takes four parameters:
	* `activity`: The activity that is starting the new activity.
	* `intent`: The intent that describes the activity to start.
	* `requestCode`: The request code for the activity.
	* `options`: The options for the activity.
3. `finishAffinity(Activity activity)`: This method finishes the activity and all of its activities in the same task affinity. It takes one parameter:
	* `activity`: The activity that is being finished.

The `ActivityCompatJB` class is used to provide compatibility for activities that were written before the introduction of the `startActivity()` and `startActivityForResult()` methods in Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). These methods were added in Android 4.0 to provide a more flexible way of starting and finishing activities. The `ActivityCompatJB` class provides a compatibility layer for these methods, allowing older activities to continue working on newer versions of Android.</s>
