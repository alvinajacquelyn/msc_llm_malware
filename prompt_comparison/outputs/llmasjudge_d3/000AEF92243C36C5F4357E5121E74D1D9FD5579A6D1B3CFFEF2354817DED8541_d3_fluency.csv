The only thing that keeps the fluency score from being perfect is the use of the `d3.select` function to select the SVG element. While this is a common practice, it can be more concise to use the `d3.selectAll` function to select all SVG elements with the class ""bar"" in one line.

Here's an example of how the code could be improved:
```
d3.selectAll(""svg.bar"")
  .data(data)
  .enter()
  .append(""rect"")
  .attr(""x"", function(d) { return x(d.letter); })
  .attr(""y"", function(d) { return y(d.frequency); })
  .attr(""width"", x.bandwidth())
  .attr(""height"", function(d) { return height - y(d.frequency); });
```

1. The code could benefit from some comments to explain what each part of the code is doing. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand for someone who is not familiar with d3.js.
