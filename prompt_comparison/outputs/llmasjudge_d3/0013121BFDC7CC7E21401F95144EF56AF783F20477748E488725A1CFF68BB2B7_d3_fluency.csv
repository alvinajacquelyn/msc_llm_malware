The code is well-structured and easy to read, with clear and concise variable names. The use of the `d3.select()` method to select the SVG element and the `d3.append()` method to append the circle element to the SVG element is also a good practice.

The only issue with the code is that it does not include any comments to explain the purpose of the code or the variables used. Adding some comments to the code would make it more readable and easier to understand for someone who is not familiar with the code.</s>","Based on the provided code, the fluency score for d3 is 4 out of 5.
