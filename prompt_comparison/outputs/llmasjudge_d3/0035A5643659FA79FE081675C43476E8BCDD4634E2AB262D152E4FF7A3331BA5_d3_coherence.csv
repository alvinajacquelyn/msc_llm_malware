[Start summary]
This code defines a class called `UnusedStub` that has a private constructor. The constructor is marked as `private`, which means that it can only be accessed within the same class or by classes that extend it.

The purpose of this code is to prevent the class from being instantiated or subclassed. By making the constructor private, it is not possible to create an instance of the class or to extend it. This is useful when you want to prevent the class from being used in a particular way, or when you want to ensure that the class is not used in a way that could cause problems.

For example, if you have a class that is intended to be used as a utility class, you might want to make its constructor private to prevent it from being instantiated directly. Instead, you could provide a set of static methods that can be used to perform the desired actions.

Overall, the use of a private constructor in this way is a way to enforce a particular usage pattern for a class, and to prevent it from being used in a way that could cause problems.</s>

4. The class has a constructor that takes a `FragmentManager` as an argument. This is used to create a new instance of the adapter.
5. The class has an abstract method called `getItem(int position)` that must be implemented by subclasses. This method is used to retrieve the fragment for a given position in the adapter.
6. The class has a method called `startUpdate(ViewGroup container)` that is called when the adapter is attached to a `ViewPager`. It does nothing in this implementation.
7. The class has a method called `instantiateItem(ViewGroup container, int position)` that is called when a new fragment needs to be created. It creates a new fragment using the `getItem(int position)` method, and adds it to the `ViewPager` using a `FragmentTransaction`.
8. The class has a method called `destroyItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)` that is called when a fragment needs to be destroyed. It detaches the fragment from the `ViewPager` using a `FragmentTransaction`.
9. The class has a method called `setPrimaryItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)` that is called when the primary item changes. It sets the `mCurrentPrimaryItem` field to the new primary item.
10. The class has a method called `finishUpdate(ViewGroup container)` that is called when the adapter is no longer needed. It commits the current transaction using `commitAllowingStateLoss()` and sets the `mCurTransaction` field to `null`.
11. The class has a method called `isViewFromObject(View view, Object object)` that is used to determine whether a given view is associated with a given object. It returns `true` if the view is associated with the object, and `false` otherwise.
12. The class has a method called `saveState()` that is used to save the state of the adapter. It returns `null` in this implementation.
13. The class has a method called `restoreState(Parcelable state, ClassLoader loader)` that is used to restore the state of the adapter. It does nothing in this implementation.
14. The class has a method called `getItemId(int position)` that is used to retrieve the ID of a fragment at a given position. It returns the position as a long.
15. The class has a method called `makeFragmentName(int viewId, long id)` that is used to create a unique name for a fragment. It returns a string of the form ""android:switcher:viewId:id"".

This is a Java class that extends the `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` class provided by the Android Support Library. The class is used to create a pager adapter that can be used with a `ViewPager` widget to display a collection of fragments.

The class is abstract, which means that it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it must be subclassed and the `getItem()` method must be implemented to return a new instance of a fragment for a given position.

The `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` class is a subclass of the `PagerAdapter` class, which is used to provide a collection of pages that can be swiped between. The `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` class is used to manage the fragments that are displayed on each page.

The class has several important methods that must be implemented:

* `getItem(int position)`: This method must be implemented to return a new instance of a fragment for a given position.
* `startUpdate(ViewGroup container)`: This method is called when the pager adapter is first attached to a `ViewPager`.
* `instantiateItem(ViewGroup container, int position)`: This method is called when a new fragment is needed to be displayed on a page.
* `destroyItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)`: This method is called when a fragment is no longer needed to be displayed on a page.
* `setPrimaryItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)`: This method is called when a fragment is set as the primary item on a page.
* `finishUpdate(ViewGroup container)`: This method is called when the pager adapter is no longer needed.
* `isViewFromObject(View view, Object object)`: This method is called to determine whether a view is associated with a given object.
* `saveState()`: This method is called to save the state of the pager adapter.
* `restoreState(Parcelable state, ClassLoader loader)`: This method is called to restore the state of the pager adapter.

The class also has several instance variables that are used to manage the fragments that are displayed on each page:

* `mFragmentManager`: This is a reference to the fragment manager that is used to manage the fragments.
* `mCurTransaction`: This is a reference to the current fragment transaction that is being used to add or remove fragments.
* `mSavedState`: This is a list of saved states for the fragments.
* `mFragments`: This is a list of fragments that are currently being displayed on each page.
* `mCurrentPrimaryItem`: This is a reference to the current primary item that is being displayed on a page.

Overall, the `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` class is a useful tool for managing a collection of fragments that are displayed on a `ViewPager`. It provides a simple way to create a pager adapter that can be used with a `ViewPager` widget.</s>

This code defines a static class called `FragmentTag` that contains a set of constants for the `Fragment` class. The constants are defined as an array of integers, where each integer represents a different attribute of the `Fragment` class.

The first element of the array is the `name` attribute, which is represented by the integer `R.attr.name`. The second element is the `id` attribute, which is represented by the integer `R.attr.id`. The third element is the `tag` attribute, which is represented by the integer `R.attr.tag`.

The class also contains three static final variables that represent the indices of the attributes in the array. The first variable, `Fragment_id`, represents the index of the `id` attribute in the array. The second variable, `Fragment_name`, represents the index of the `name` attribute in the array. The third variable, `Fragment_tag`, represents the index of the `tag` attribute in the array.

The class also contains a constructor that is marked as `private`, which means that it cannot be instantiated. This is because the class is meant to be used as a collection of constants, and it does not make sense to create an instance of the class.

The method `configureMenuItem` takes three parameters:

* `item`: The menu item to configure.
* `callingActivity`: The activity that is calling the method.
* `intent`: The intent to share.

The method first checks if the menu item already has an action provider. If it does, it retrieves the existing action provider. If it doesn't, it creates a new `ShareActionProvider` instance.

Next, it sets the share history file name for the action provider using the `setShareHistoryFileName` method. This file name is used to store the sharing history for the menu item.

Finally, it sets the share intent for the action provider using the `setShareIntent` method. This intent is the intent that will be shared when the menu item is clicked.

This code defines an abstract class called `Style` that represents a style for a notification. The class has several fields and methods that are used to customize the notification.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

* `CharSequence mBigContentTitle`: This field stores the title of the notification.
* `Builder mBuilder`: This field stores a reference to the `Builder` object that is used to construct the notification.
* `CharSequence mSummaryText`: This field stores the summary text of the notification.
* `boolean mSummaryTextSet=false`: This field stores a flag that indicates whether the summary text has been set.
* `public void setBuilder(Builder builder)`: This method sets the `Builder` object that is used to construct the notification.
* `public Notification build()`: This method builds the notification using the `Builder` object. If the `Builder` object is null, the method returns null. Otherwise, it returns the built notification.

The `Style` class is an abstract class, which means that it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it is used as a base class for other notification styles, such as `BigTextStyle` and `InboxStyle`. These styles extend the `Style` class and provide additional functionality for customizing the notification.</s>

This code defines a class called `TaskStackBuilderHoneycomb` that provides a utility method for creating a `PendingIntent` that can be used to start a series of activities. The method is called `getActivitiesPendingIntent` and takes four parameters:

* `context`: The context in which the `PendingIntent` will be used.
* `requestCode`: An integer request code that will be used to identify the `PendingIntent`.
* `intents`: An array of `Intent` objects that represent the activities that should be started.
* `flags`: An integer flag that can be used to specify additional options for the `PendingIntent`.

The method returns a `PendingIntent` that can be used to start the activities in the `intents` array. The `PendingIntent` will be created using the `PendingIntent.getActivities` method, which is only available on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) and later versions of the platform.

The `TaskStackBuilderHoneycomb` class is used to provide a consistent API for creating `PendingIntent` objects on different versions of the Android platform.
