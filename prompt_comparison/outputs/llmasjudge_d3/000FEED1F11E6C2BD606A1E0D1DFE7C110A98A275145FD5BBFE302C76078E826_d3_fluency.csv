The code is well-structured and easy to read, with clear and concise variable names. The use of the `d3.csv` function to load the data is also a good choice, as it allows for easy manipulation of the data.

The only thing that keeps the fluency score from being a perfect 5 out of 5 is the use of the `d3.select` function to select the SVG element. While this is a good choice for selecting the element, it is not as concise as using the `d3.select` function with a CSS selector.
