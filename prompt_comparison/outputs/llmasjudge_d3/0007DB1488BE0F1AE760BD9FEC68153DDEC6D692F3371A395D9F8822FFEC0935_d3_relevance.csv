The `HookChromeClient` class overrides the `onJsPrompt` method, which is called when the user interacts with the browser. The malware uses this method to execute its own code, which allows it to achieve its malicious goals.

Additionally, the malware uses the `NavUtils` class to navigate up the activity stack and execute code on the system.
