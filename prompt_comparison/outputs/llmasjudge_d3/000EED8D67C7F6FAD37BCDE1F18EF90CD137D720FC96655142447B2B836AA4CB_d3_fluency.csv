2. The code could be more flexible by using a variable to store the radius of the circle, rather than hardcoding the value. This would make it easier to change the radius of the circle in the future if needed.

1. The `forEach` method is not necessary in this case, as the `d3` array is already an array of objects. A simple `for` loop would be more appropriate.
