No, this code does not contain instances of the malware objective known as Execution. The code is a Java class that defines a static method for installing an APK file on an Android device. The method uses the `PackageManager` class to check if the APK file is already installed, and if not, it uses the `Intent` class to launch the installation process. The code does not contain any code that would enable malware to execute code on a system to achieve a variety of goals.</s>
