This code defines an interface named `b` with a type parameter named `D`. The interface has no methods or fields, but it can be used as a base class for other interfaces or classes that need to specify a type parameter.

The type parameter `D` is a placeholder for a specific type that will be used in the implementation of the interface. For example, if we have a class `A` that implements `b<String>`, then `A` can use the type parameter `D` to specify that it will use `String` as the type for its implementation.

The use of type parameters in interfaces is a powerful feature that allows for greater flexibility and reusability in code.

This is a Java class that extends the `TabHost` class and implements the `TabHost.OnTabChangeListener` interface. It is used to manage a set of tabs, where each tab is represented by a `Fragment`.

The class has the following members:

* `a`: an `ArrayList` of `u` objects, where each `u` object represents a tab.
* `b`: a `Context` object, which is used to create the `Fragment` objects.
* `c`: a `l` object, which is used to create the `Fragment` objects.
* `d`: an integer that represents the current tab.
* `e`: a `TabHost.OnTabChangeListener` object, which is used to listen for changes to the current tab.
* `f`: a `u` object, which represents the current tab.
* `g`: a boolean that indicates whether the `Fragment` objects have been created.

The class has the following methods:

* `a(String, v)`: a method that creates a `v` object and sets the current tab to the specified tab.
* `onAttachedToWindow()`: a method that is called when the `FragmentTabHost` is attached to a window. It creates the `Fragment` objects and sets the current tab to the specified tab.
* `onDetachedFromWindow()`: a method that is called when the `FragmentTabHost` is detached from a window. It destroys the `Fragment` objects.
* `onRestoreInstanceState(Parcelable)`: a method that is called when the `FragmentTabHost` is restored from an instance state. It sets the current tab to the specified tab.
* `onSaveInstanceState()`: a method that is called when the `FragmentTabHost` is saved to an instance state. It returns a `SavedState` object that contains the current tab.
* `onTabChanged(String)`: a method that is called when the current tab changes. It updates the current tab and notifies the `TabHost.OnTabChangeListener` object.
* `setOnTabChangedListener(TabHost.OnTabChangeListener)`: a method that sets the `TabHost.OnTabChangeListener` object.
* `setup()`: a method that is called when the `FragmentTabHost` is set up. It is deprecated and should not be used.

The class also has a `SavedState` inner class that is used to save the current tab to an instance state.</s>

* `a`: This is an integer field that represents the ID of the loader.
* `b`: This is a `Bundle` field that contains any arguments that were passed to the loader when it was created.
* `c`: This is a `x<Object>` field that represents the callbacks that will be used to deliver the results of the loader.
* `d`: This is an `android.support.v4.a.a<Object>` field that represents the loader itself.
* `e`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has finished delivering its results.
* `f`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has delivered its results.
* `g`: This is an `Object` field that contains the results of the loader.
* `h`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has been started.
* `i`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has been retained.
* `j`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has been started and retained.
* `k`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has been stopped.
* `l`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has been destroyed.
* `m`: This is a boolean field that indicates whether the loader has been registered with the `LoaderManager`.
* `n`: This is a `z` field that represents the next loader in the chain.
* `o`: This is a `y` field that represents the `LoaderManager` that created the loader.

The class has several methods, but I'll explain the most important ones:

* `a()`: This method is called when the loader is started. It checks whether the loader has already been started and whether it has been retained, and if not, it creates a new instance of the loader and starts it.
* `a(android.support.v4.a.a<Object> aVar, Object obj)`: This method is called when the loader has finished delivering its results. It checks whether the loader has already delivered its results and if not, it delivers the results to the callbacks.
* `b()`: This method is called when the loader is retained. It sets the `i` field to true and the `j` field to the value of the `h` field.
* `c()`: This method is called when the loader is finished retaining. It sets the `i` field to false and the `j` field to the value of the `h` field.
* `d()`: This method is called when the loader is stopped. It sets the `h` field to false.
* `e()`: This method is called when the loader is destroyed. It sets the `l` field to true and calls the `f()` method to destroy the loader.
* `f()`: This method is called when the loader is reset. It sets the `g` field to null and calls the `c()` method to reset the loader.

This code defines a class `b` that extends the `f` class and implements the `Map` interface. The `b` class has a constructor that takes an `a` object as a parameter, and it has several methods that are overridden from the `f` class and the `Map` interface.

The `a` object is a private field of the `b` class, and it is used to store the data that the `b` class is responsible for managing. The `a` object is passed to the `b` class in the constructor, and it is used to access the data in the `a` object.

The `b` class has several methods that are overridden from the `f` class and the `Map` interface. These methods include:

* `a()`: This method returns the number of key-value pairs in the map. It is implemented by calling the `h` method of the `a` object.
* `a(Object obj)`: This method returns the value associated with the given key. It is implemented by calling the `a` method of the `a` object, passing in the key and the hash code of the key.
* `a(int i, int i2)`: This method returns the value associated with the given key. It is implemented by calling the `g` method of the `a` object, passing in the key and the hash code of the key.
* `a(int i, V v)`: This method returns the value associated with the given key. It is implemented by calling the `a` method of the `a` object, passing in the key and the hash code of the key.
* `a(int i)`: This method removes the key-value pair with the given index from the map. It is implemented by calling the `d` method of the `a` object, passing in the index.
* `a(K k, V v)`: This method adds the given key-value pair to the map. It is implemented by calling the `put` method of the `a` object, passing in the key and the value.
* `b()`: This method returns a new map that contains all the key-value pairs in the original map. It is implemented by calling the `b` method of the `a` object.
* `c()`: This method clears the map, removing all key-value pairs. It is implemented by calling the `clear` method of the `a` object.

Overall, the `b` class provides a wrapper around the `a` object, allowing it to be used as a map. The `b` class provides a simple way to access and manipulate the data in the `a` object, while also providing a consistent interface for working with maps.</s>

This code defines a class named `c` with three static final arrays: `a`, `b`, and `c`. The `a` array is an array of integers, the `b` array is an array of longs, and the `c` array is an array of objects.

The class also defines three static methods: `a`, `a`, and `b`. The `a` method takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The `a` method takes an integer array, an integer start index, and an integer end index as arguments, and returns the index of the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to the given integer. The `b` method takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The `b` method takes an integer argument and returns the next power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the given integer.

The `a` method uses a binary search algorithm to find the first element in the array that is greater than or equal to the given integer. It starts by finding the middle index of the array, and then checks if the element at that index is greater than or equal to the given integer. If it is, it returns the index. If it is not, it checks if the element at the middle index is less than the given integer. If it is, it returns the index of the previous element. If it is not, it repeats the process with the left and right halves of the array until it finds the first element that is greater than or equal to the given integer.

The `b` method uses a simple loop to find the next power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the given integer. It starts by assuming that the next power of 2 is equal to the given integer, and then checks if it is a power of 2. If it is not, it adds 1 to the integer and checks again until it finds a power of 2.

The `a` method and the `b` method are both static methods, which means that they can be called without creating an instance of the class. The `a` method and the `b` method are both public, which means that they can be accessed from outside the class. The `a` method and the `b` method are both final, which means that they cannot be overridden or extended.</s>

This code defines a method called `a` that takes two parameters: `obj` and `sb`. The method is defined in the `d` class.

The method first checks if the `obj` parameter is null. If it is, it appends the string ""null"" to the `sb` parameter and returns.

If `obj` is not null, the method gets the simple name of the class of the `obj` parameter using the `getClass()` method. If the simple name is null or empty, it gets the full class name of the `obj` parameter using the `getName()` method and extracts the simple name by removing everything before the last dot (`.`) character.

The method then appends the simple name to the `sb` parameter and appends the string ""{"".

Next, it appends the hexadecimal representation of the identity hash code of the `obj` parameter to the `sb` parameter.

Finally, the method appends the string ""}"" to the `sb` parameter and returns.

This code defines a custom `Writer` class called `e` that extends the `Writer` class in Java. The `e` class has a private field called `a` that is a `String`, and a private field called `b` that is a `StringBuilder` with an initial capacity of 128 characters.

The constructor of the `e` class takes a `String` parameter called `str` and assigns it to the `a` field.

The `a()` method is called whenever the `Writer` is closed or flushed. It checks if the `b` field has any characters in it, and if so, it logs the contents of the `b` field to the Android log with a tag equal to the value of the `a` field. It then clears the `b` field.

The `write()` method overrides the `write()` method of the `Writer` class. It takes a `char[]` parameter called `cArr`, an `int` parameter called `i`, and an `int` parameter called `i2`. It iterates over the characters in the `cArr` array, starting at index `i`, and appends each character to the `b` field. If the character is a newline (`\n`), it calls the `a()` method to log the contents of the `b` field. Otherwise, it appends the character to the `b` field.

This code defines a generic class `g` that implements the `Iterator` interface. The class takes a single parameter of type `f` and an integer `i`.

The class has four fields:

* `a`: an integer that represents the number of elements in the iterator.
* `b`: an integer that represents the current position of the iterator.
* `c`: an integer that represents the next position of the iterator.
* `d`: a boolean that represents whether the iterator has been removed.

The class also has four methods:

* `hasNext()`: returns `true` if the iterator has more elements, and `false` otherwise.
* `next()`: returns the next element in the iterator, and increments the `c` field.
* `remove()`: removes the last element returned by the iterator, and decrements the `b` field.

The `g` class is final, which means that it cannot be extended or subclassed. The `e` field is also final, which means that it cannot be reassigned.

The `g` class is constructed with a `f` object and an integer `i`. The `a` field is initialized to the number of elements in the `f` object, and the `b` field is initialized to the current position of the iterator. The `c` field is initialized to the next position of the iterator.

The `hasNext()` method returns `true` if the `c` field is less than the `b` field, which means that there are still elements in the iterator. The `next()` method returns the next element in the iterator, and increments the `c` field. The `remove()` method removes the last element returned by the iterator, and decrements the `b` field.

This code defines a class named `h` that implements the `Set` interface for a specific type of map. The class is defined as a final class, which means it cannot be extended or subclassed.

The `h` class has a constructor that takes no arguments and initializes the map. It also implements several methods from the `Set` interface, including `add`, `addAll`, `clear`, `contains`, `containsAll`, `equals`, `hashCode`, `isEmpty`, `iterator`, `remove`, `removeAll`, `retainAll`, and `size`.

The `add` method is not implemented, as it is not possible to add new entries to a map. The `addAll` method is implemented by iterating over the given collection of entries and adding each one to the map using the `add` method. The `clear` method is implemented by calling the `c` method on the map, which clears all entries from the map.

The `contains` method is implemented by first checking if the given object is an instance of `Map.Entry`. If it is not, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, it gets the key and value from the entry and checks if they are present in the map using the `a` method. If the key is present, the method returns `true` if the value matches the value in the map, and `false` otherwise. If the key is not present, the method returns `false`.

The `containsAll` method is implemented by iterating over the given collection of entries and calling the `contains` method for each one. If any entry is not present in the map, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, the method returns `true`.

The `equals` method is implemented by calling the `a` method on the given object and comparing the result to the result of calling the `a` method on the map. If the result is the same, the method returns `true`. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.

The `hashCode` method is implemented by iterating over the entries in the map and calculating the hash code for each one. The hash code for each entry is calculated by combining the hash codes of the key and value using the `^` operator. The method returns the result of this calculation.

The `isEmpty` method is implemented by calling the `a` method on the map and checking if the result is zero. If it is, the method returns `true`. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.

The `iterator` method is implemented by creating a new instance of the `j` class, which is a private inner class that implements the `Iterator` interface. The `j` class has a constructor that takes a reference to the map and initializes the iterator. The `j` class also implements the `hasNext` method and the `next` method, which are used to iterate over the entries in the map.

The `remove` method is not implemented, as it is not possible to remove entries from a map. The `removeAll` method is not implemented, as it is not possible to remove all entries from a map. The `retainAll` method is not implemented, as it is not possible to remove all entries from a map.

The `size` method is implemented by calling the `a` method on the map and returning the result.

* `remove(Object obj)`: This method removes the specified object from the set if it is present, and returns `true` if it was present, and `false` otherwise. It does this by calling the `a(Object)` method on the `f` object, which returns the index of the specified object in the set, or `-1` if it is not present. If the index is not `-1`, the method calls the `a(int)` method on the `f` object to remove the object at that index.

This is a Java class that implements the `Collection` interface. It is a final class, which means it cannot be extended or subclassed.

The class has a constructor that takes no arguments and initializes the collection to be empty.

The class implements the following methods of the `Collection` interface:

* `add(V v)`: This method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` because the collection is immutable.
* `addAll(Collection<? extends V> collection)`: This method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` because the collection is immutable.
* `clear()`: This method clears the collection by calling the `c()` method of the parent class, which is a private method that is used to clear the collection.
* `contains(Object obj)`: This method returns `true` if the collection contains the specified object, and `false` otherwise. It does this by calling the `b(Object)` method of the parent class, which returns the index of the specified object in the collection, or `-1` if it is not found.
* `containsAll(Collection<?> collection)`: This method returns `true` if the collection contains all the elements of the specified collection, and `false` otherwise. It does this by iterating over the specified collection and calling the `contains(Object)` method for each element.
* `isEmpty()`: This method returns `true` if the collection is empty, and `false` otherwise. It does this by calling the `a()` method of the parent class, which returns the number of elements in the collection.
* `iterator()`: This method returns an iterator over the elements of the collection. It does this by creating a new instance of the `g` class, which is a private inner class that implements the `Iterator` interface.
* `remove(Object obj)`: This method removes the specified object from the collection if it is present, and returns `true` if it was present, and `false` otherwise. It does this by calling the `b(Object)` method of the parent class, which returns the index of the specified object in the collection, or `-1` if it is not found. If the index is not `-1`, the `a(int)` method of the parent class is called to remove the object at that index.
* `removeAll(Collection<?> collection)`: This method removes all the elements of the specified collection from the collection if they are present, and returns `true` if any of them were present, and `false` otherwise. It does this by iterating over the specified collection and calling the `remove(Object)` method for each element.
* `retainAll(Collection<?> collection)`: This method retains only the elements of the specified collection in the collection, and returns `true` if any of them were present, and `false` otherwise. It does this by iterating over the specified collection and calling the `remove(Object)` method for each element that is not present in the collection.
* `size()`: This method returns the number of elements in the collection. It does this by calling the `a()` method of the parent class, which returns the number of elements in the collection.
* `toArray()`: This method returns an array containing all the elements of the collection. It does this by calling the `b(int)` method of the parent class, which returns an array containing all the elements of the collection.
* `toArray(T[] tArr)`: This method returns an array containing all the elements of the collection. It does this by calling the `a(T[], int)` method of the parent class, which returns an array containing all the elements of the collection.

The class also implements the `Collection` interface, which means it can be used as a collection of elements.</s>

This code defines a class named `ak` with a single static method named `a`. The method takes two parameters: `view` and `i`.

The method first checks if the `view` object can scroll horizontally in the direction specified by the `i` parameter. If the `view` can scroll horizontally, the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The method is defined as a static method, which means that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. This is useful when you want to call a method that doesn't require an instance of an object.

The method is defined in the `ak` class, which is a simple class that contains only this one method. The class name `ak` is not particularly meaningful, but it is a valid name for a class in Java.</s>

This code defines a class named `al` that contains three static methods for working with Android views.

The first method, `a(View view)`, takes a `View` object as an argument and calls the `postInvalidateOnAnimation()` method on it. This method invalidates the view and requests that it be redrawn on the next animation frame.

The second method, `a(View view, int i, int i2, int i3, int i4)`, takes a `View` object and four integer arguments as arguments. It calls the `postInvalidate(int, int, int, int)` method on the view, passing in the four integer arguments. This method invalidates the view and requests that it be redrawn in the specified region.

The third method, `a(View view, Runnable runnable)`, takes a `View` object and a `Runnable` object as arguments. It calls the `postOnAnimation(Runnable)` method on the view, passing in the `Runnable` object. This method schedules the `Runnable` object to be executed on the next animation frame.

This code defines a class called `an` that implements the `Comparator` interface. The `Comparator` interface is used to compare two objects of the same type and return a value indicating their relative order.

In this case, the `an` class compares two objects of type `aq` and returns a value indicating their relative order based on the value of the `b` field of each object. The `b` field is an integer value that represents the priority of each object.

The `compare` method of the `an` class takes two `aq` objects as arguments and returns an integer value indicating their relative order. The method first subtracts the `b` field of the second object from the `b` field of the first object, and then returns the result. If the result is positive, it means that the first object has a higher priority than the second object, and the method returns a value greater than 0. If the result is negative, it means that the first object has a lower priority than the second object, and the method returns a value less than 0. If the result is 0, it means that the two objects have the same priority, and the method returns 0.
