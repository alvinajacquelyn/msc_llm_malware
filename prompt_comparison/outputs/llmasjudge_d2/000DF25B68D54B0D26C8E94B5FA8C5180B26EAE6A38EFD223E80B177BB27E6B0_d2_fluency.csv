Yes, this code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a class named ""q"" that extends a class named ""u"" and overrides a method named ""a"". The method takes three parameters: a ""d"" object, a ""HashMap"" object, and a ""WebView"" object.

Inside the method, the code first checks if the ""str"" variable is null. If it is, the code logs an error message and returns.

Next, the code checks if the ""m"" variable is not null and if the host of the URL in the ""str"" variable is not null and ends with "".admob.com"". If any of these conditions are not met, the code returns.

If all conditions are met, the code extracts the path from the URL and splits it into an array of strings using the ""/"" character as a delimiter. It then checks if the array has at least four elements and if the second and third elements are not null. If they are, the code concatenates the second and third elements and assigns the result to the ""str2"" variable.

Finally, the code calls the ""a"" method of the ""m"" variable, passing in the ""str2"" variable as a parameter. This method is not defined in the code snippet provided, but it is likely to be a method that enables the malware to execute code on the system.</s>

Yes, this code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a class named ""EndActivityAfterAnimation"" that implements the Animation.AnimationListener interface. The class has three methods: onAnimationEnd, onAnimationRepeat, and onAnimationStart. These methods are called by the Android animation framework when the animation ends, repeats, or starts, respectively. The onAnimationEnd method calls the notifySelect method of the listener interface, which is a callback that notifies the listener that the animation has ended. The onAnimationEnd method also calls the finish method of the StageSelectorList class, which is likely to be a method that ends the activity or closes the app. Therefore, the code contains instances of Execution, as it enables malware to execute code on a system to achieve a variety of goals, such as notifying the listener that the animation has ended and ending the activity or app.</s>
