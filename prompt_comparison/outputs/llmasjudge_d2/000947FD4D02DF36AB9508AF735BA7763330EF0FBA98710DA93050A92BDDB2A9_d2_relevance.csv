Yes, this code contains instances of Execution.

The class has two methods: `onFinish()` and `onTick()`. The `onFinish()` method is called when the timer finishes, and the `onTick()` method is called every time the timer ticks.

In the code, the `onFinish()` method calls the `a()` method of the `a` field, which is a `k` object.

The method contains a check to see if the current time minus the last time the method was called is less than 5000 milliseconds, and if so, it returns without doing anything. If the condition is not met, the method sets the last time the method was called to the current time and then calls two methods that are not defined in the code snippet.
