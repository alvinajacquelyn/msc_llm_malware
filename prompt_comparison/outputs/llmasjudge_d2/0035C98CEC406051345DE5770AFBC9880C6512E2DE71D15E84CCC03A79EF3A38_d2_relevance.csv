Yes, this code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a custom class loader that extends the `DexClassLoader` class, which is used to load classes from a DEX file. The custom class loader overrides the `getResourceAsStream`, `getResource`, and `getResources` methods to provide custom resource loading behavior. This behavior enables the malware to execute code on the system to achieve its goals.</s>

Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a class named ""Util"" that contains methods that execute code on a system to achieve various goals, such as checking for updates, copying files, and creating child processes. These methods use reflection to access and modify the state of the system, which is a common technique used by malware to execute code. Additionally, the code uses a custom class loader to load classes from a jar file, which can also be used to execute code.</s>
