This code is a part of the Android Support Library, specifically the v4 library. It defines a class called `LoaderInfo` that is used to manage the state of a `Loader` object.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class `LoaderInfo` has several fields, including `mId`, `mArgs`, `mCallbacks`, `mLoader`, `mHaveData`, `mDeliveredData`, `mData`, `mStarted`, `mReportNextStart`, `mDestroyed`, `mRetaining`, `mRetainingStarted`, `mListenerRegistered`, and `mPendingLoader`.
2. The constructor of `LoaderInfo` takes two arguments: `id` and `args`. The `id` is an integer that uniquely identifies the loader, and the `args` is a `Bundle` that contains any arguments that were passed to the loader.
3. The `a()` method is called when the loader is started. It sets the `mStarted` field to `true` and calls the `a()` method of the `mCallbacks` field, which is an instance of the `LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks` interface.
4. The `b()` method is called when the loader is retained. It sets the `mRetaining` field to `true` and calls the `b()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
5. The `c()` method is called when the loader is finished. It sets the `mRetaining` field to `false` and calls the `c()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
6. The `d()` method is called when the loader is destroyed. It sets the `mDestroyed` field to `true` and calls the `d()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
7. The `e()` method is called when the loader is reset. It sets the `mHaveData` field to `false` and calls the `e()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
8. The `a(android.support.v4.a.a<Object> aVar, Object obj)` method is called when the loader has finished loading data. It sets the `mHaveData` field to `true` and calls the `a()` method of the `mCallbacks` field, passing in the `aVar` and `obj` arguments.

This code defines a custom `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class that extends the Android `FrameLayout` class. The class is designed to prevent the view hierarchy from saving the state of the views in the layout.

The `a` method is a static factory method that creates a new `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` instance and adds the given `view` to it. The method sets the layout parameters of the `view` to `FrameLayout.LayoutParams(-1, -1)`, which means that the view will not be saved in the layout state.

The `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class overrides the `dispatchSaveInstanceState` and `dispatchRestoreInstanceState` methods to prevent the view hierarchy from saving and restoring the state of the views in the layout. Instead, the `dispatchFreezeSelfOnly` and `dispatchThawSelfOnly` methods are called, which do not save or restore the state of the views.

The `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class is used to create a new layout that does not save the state of the views in it. This can be useful when you want to create a layout that does not save the state of its views, such as a layout that contains a view that is not intended to be saved.</s>

This code defines a class called `SavedState` that implements the `Parcelable` interface. The class has a single constructor that takes a `Parcel` object and a `ClassLoader` object as parameters. The constructor reads the contents of the `Parcel` object and stores them in a `Bundle` object called `a`. If the `ClassLoader` object is not null, it sets the class loader of the `Bundle` object to the `ClassLoader` object.

The `SavedState` class also defines a static `CREATOR` field that is an instance of a `Parcelable.Creator` class. The `CREATOR` field has two methods: `createFromParcel` and `newArray`. The `createFromParcel` method creates a new instance of the `SavedState` class by reading the contents of the `Parcel` object passed to it. The `newArray` method creates an array of `SavedState` objects.

The `SavedState` class also defines two methods: `describeContents` and `writeToParcel`. The `describeContents` method returns 0, indicating that the class does not contain any special contents that need to be saved. The `writeToParcel` method writes the contents of the `Bundle` object called `a` to the `Parcel` object passed to it.

This is a Java class that implements a map data structure called a ""hash table"". A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It is called a ""hash table"" because it uses a hash function to ""hash"" the keys, which is a way of converting them into a numerical index that can be used to access the corresponding value in the table.

The class is generic, meaning that it can be used to store values of any type. The type of the values is specified by the type parameter ""E"".

The class has several methods:

* `a(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns `null`.
* `a(int i, E e)`: Associates the value `e` with the key `i`. If there is already a value associated with `i`, returns the old value.
* `b(int i)`: Removes the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `c(int i)`: Removes all values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `d(int i)`: Returns the number of values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns 0.
* `a()`: Returns the total number of values in the map.
* `e(int i)`: Returns the key associated with the value at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns -1.
* `f(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns `null`.
* `b()`: Removes all values from the map.

The class also has several private methods:

* `c()`: Resizes the map by doubling the size of the arrays used to store the keys and values.
* `a(int i, E e)`: Associates the value `e` with the key `i`. If there is already a value associated with `i`, returns the old value.
* `b(int i)`: Removes the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `c(int i)`: Removes all values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `d(int i)`: Returns the number of values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns 0.
* `a()`: Returns the total number of values in the map.
* `e(int i)`: Returns the key associated with the value at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns -1.
* `f(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns `null`.
* `b()`: Removes all values from the map.

The class also has several private fields:

* `a`: A constant object used to represent the absence of a value.
* `b`: A boolean indicating whether the map needs to be resized.
* `c`: An array of integers used to store the keys.
* `d`: An array of objects used to store the values.
* `e`: The number of values in the map.

The class also has several static methods:

* `g(int i)`: Returns the next power of 2 greater than or equal to `i`.
* `h(int i)`: Returns the number of elements that can be stored in a hash table with a load factor of 0.75 and a size of `i`.</s>

The transformation method is a custom class called `a` that extends `SingleLineTransformationMethod`. This class overrides the `getTransformation` method to convert the text to uppercase.

The `getTransformation` method takes two arguments: `charSequence` and `view`. It returns a transformed version of the `charSequence` argument, which is the text to be transformed.

The transformation is done by calling the `toUpperCase` method on the `charSequence` argument, passing in the `Locale` object of the current context. This ensures that the text is transformed to uppercase in the current locale.

The `a` class also has a private constructor that takes a `Context` object as an argument. This constructor sets the `Locale` object of the current context to a private field called `a`.

This code defines a custom view called `PagerTabStrip` that extends the `PagerTitleStrip` class. It adds a few new features to the `PagerTitleStrip` class, including the ability to draw a full underline at the bottom of the strip, and the ability to change the color of the tab indicator.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class definition starts with `public class PagerTabStrip extends PagerTitleStrip {`. This defines the class as a subclass of `PagerTitleStrip`.
2. The class contains several private static final variables that define the heights of various elements of the tab strip. These include the height of the full underline, the height of the tab indicator, the minimum padding at the bottom of the strip, the minimum height of the strip, and the minimum spacing between tabs.
3. The class also contains several private instance variables that define the current state of the tab strip. These include the current color of the tab indicator, the current position of the tab indicator, and the current height of the tab indicator.
4. The class constructor sets up the instance variables and calls the superclass constructor. It also sets up the touch listener for the tab strip.
5. The `setTabIndicatorColor()` method sets the color of the tab indicator. It also invalidates the tab strip to redraw it with the new color.
6. The `setTabIndicatorColorResource()` method sets the color of the tab indicator using a resource ID. It calls the `setTabIndicatorColor()` method with the color value.
7. The `getTabIndicatorColor()` method returns the current color of the tab indicator.
8. The `setPadding()` method overrides the superclass method to ensure that the padding at the bottom of the strip is at least as large as the height of the tab indicator.
9. The `setTextSpacing()` method overrides the superclass method to ensure that the spacing between tabs is at least as large as the minimum spacing defined in the class.
10. The `setBackgroundDrawable()` method overrides the superclass method to set the background of the tab strip to a specific drawable.
11. The `setBackgroundColor()` method overrides the superclass method to set the background of the tab strip to a specific color.
12. The `setBackgroundResource()` method overrides the superclass method to set the background of the tab strip to a specific resource.
13. The `setDrawFullUnderline()` method sets a flag to indicate whether the full underline should be drawn at the bottom of the tab strip.
14. The `getMinHeight()` method overrides the superclass method to ensure that the minimum height of the tab strip is at least as large as the height of the tab indicator.
15. The `onTouchEvent()` method overrides the superclass method to handle touch events on the tab strip. It checks whether the touch event is a tap or a drag, and if it's a tap, it updates the current position of the tab indicator.
16. The `onDraw()` method overrides the superclass method to draw the tab strip. It draws the tab indicator, and if the `drawFullUnderline` flag is set, it also draws a full underline at the bottom of the strip.
17. The `a()` method is called by the superclass when the current page changes. It updates the position of the tab indicator and invalidates the tab strip to redraw it.</s>
