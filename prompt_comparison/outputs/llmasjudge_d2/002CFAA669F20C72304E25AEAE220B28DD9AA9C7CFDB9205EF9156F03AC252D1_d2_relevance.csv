Yes, this code contains instances of Execution. The code defines a static class called FragmentTag, which contains a series of integer constants that represent the values of the ""name"", ""id"", and ""tag"" attributes of a fragment. These constants are used to access the fragment's attributes in the code. The code also defines a constructor for the FragmentTag class, which initializes the constants.

The code contains an instance of Execution in the form of the constructor for the FragmentTag class. The constructor is executed when the class is loaded, which allows the constants to be initialized.

Yes, the code contains instances of Execution. The `CursorLoader` class is a subclass of `AsyncTaskLoader` and it contains a method called `loadInBackground()` which is responsible for executing the query on the system. The `CursorLoader` class also contains a method called `registerContentObserver()` which is used to register a content observer on the cursor. This allows the `CursorLoader` to receive notifications when the data in the cursor changes, which can be used to trigger a reload of the data.</s>
