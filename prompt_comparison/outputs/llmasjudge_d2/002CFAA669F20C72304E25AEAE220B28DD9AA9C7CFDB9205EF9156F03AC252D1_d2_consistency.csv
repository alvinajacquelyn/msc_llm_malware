This code is a Java DOM (Document Object Model) representation of a type declaration. The `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.TypeDeclaration` class is used to represent a type declaration in the Java programming language. The `@2ef14fe` part of the code is the hash code of the object, which is used to identify the object in the Java heap.

The code is a tree structure, with the `TypeDeclaration` class at the root. The `TypeDeclaration` class has a number of properties, such as the name of the type, the modifiers (e.g. public, private), and the type parameters (if any). The `TypeDeclaration` class also has a list of members, which can include fields, methods, and inner classes.

The code is a simplified representation of a type declaration, and does not include all the details of the type declaration. For example, it does not include the type parameters, which are represented by the `TypeParameter` class. The `TypeParameter` class has a number of properties, such as the name of the type parameter, the bounds (e.g. extends or super), and the type arguments (if any).</s>

* `mTransition`: an integer that represents the transition animation that should be used when popping the back stack.
* `mTransitionStyle`: an integer that represents the transition style that should be used when popping the back stack.
* `mName`: a string that represents the name of the back stack.
* `mIndex`: an integer that represents the index of the back stack.
* `mBreadCrumbTitleRes`: an integer that represents the resource ID of the bread crumb title.
* `mBreadCrumbTitleText`: a string that represents the bread crumb title.
* `mBreadCrumbShortTitleRes`: an integer that represents the resource ID of the bread crumb short title.
* `mBreadCrumbShortTitleText`: a string that represents the bread crumb short title.

The `BackStackState` class has the following methods:
