This code defines a class called `UnusedStub` that has a private constructor. The constructor is marked as `private`, which means that it can only be accessed within the same class or by classes that extend it.

The purpose of this code is to prevent the class from being instantiated or subclassed. By making the constructor private, it prevents anyone from creating an instance of the class or subclassing it.

This code is often used in situations where a class is not intended to be used directly, but rather as a base class for other classes. By making the constructor private, it prevents the class from being used directly, which helps to ensure that the class is used correctly and in a way that is consistent with its intended purpose.</s>

This code defines an interface called `ActionBarDrawerToggleImpl` that provides methods for customizing the appearance of the action bar in an activity. The interface has three methods:

1. `getThemeUpIndicator(Activity activity)`: This method returns a drawable that represents the ""up"" indicator in the action bar. The drawable is typically used to indicate that the user can navigate back to the previous screen.
2. `setActionBarDescription(Object obj, Activity activity, int i)`: This method sets the description of the action bar to the specified string resource. The `obj` parameter is a reference to the action bar, and the `activity` parameter is a reference to the activity that contains the action bar. The `i` parameter is the resource ID of the string to be used as the description.
3. `setActionBarUpIndicator(Object obj, Activity activity, Drawable drawable, int i)`: This method sets the ""up"" indicator in the action bar to the specified drawable. The `obj` parameter is a reference to the action bar, and the `activity` parameter is a reference to the activity that contains the action bar. The `drawable` parameter is the drawable to be used as the ""up"" indicator, and the `i` parameter is the resource ID of the string to be used as the description of the ""up"" indicator.

The `ActionBarDrawerToggleImpl` interface is used by the `ActionBarDrawerToggle` class to customize the appearance of the action bar in an activity. The `ActionBarDrawerToggle` class is used to create a toggle button that can be used to open and close a navigation drawer.

This code defines a class called `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` that is a wrapper around the `ActivityOptions` class in the Android framework. The `ActivityOptions` class provides a way to specify custom animation options when starting a new activity.

The `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` class provides a set of static methods that create instances of `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` with different animation options. These methods are similar to the corresponding methods in the `ActivityOptions` class, but they return instances of `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` instead of `ActivityOptions`.

The `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` class also provides a `toBundle()` method that returns a `Bundle` object containing the animation options. This `Bundle` object can be used to pass the animation options to the `startActivity()` method.

The `update()` method is used to update the animation options of an existing `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` object with the options of another `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` object. This method is used to combine the animation options of multiple `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` objects into a single `Bundle` object.

Overall, the `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` class provides a way to specify custom animation options when starting a new activity in a backwards-compatible way.</s>

This code defines a private static class called `ActivityOptionsImplJB` that extends the `ActivityOptionsCompat` class. The class is defined inside the `android.support.v4.app` package.

The `ActivityOptionsImplJB` class has a private field called `mImpl` of type `ActivityOptionsCompatJB`. This field is used to store a reference to an instance of the `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` class.

The `ActivityOptionsImplJB` class has two constructors:

1. A constructor that takes a single argument of type `ActivityOptionsCompatJB`. This constructor initializes the `mImpl` field with the provided `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` instance.
2. A constructor that takes no arguments. This constructor initializes the `mImpl` field with a new instance of the `ActivityOptionsCompatJB` class.

The `ActivityOptionsImplJB` class overrides the `toBundle()` method of the `ActivityOptionsCompat` class. This method returns the `Bundle` object that is stored in the `mImpl` field.

The `ActivityOptionsImplJB` class also overrides the `update()` method of the `ActivityOptionsCompat` class. This method updates the `mImpl` field with the provided `ActivityOptionsCompat` instance. If the provided instance is an instance of the `ActivityOptionsImplJB` class, the method updates the `mImpl` field with the `mImpl` field of the provided instance. Otherwise, the method does nothing.

In summary, the `ActivityOptionsImplJB` class is a helper class that provides a way to store and manipulate `ActivityOptionsCompat` instances in a way that is compatible with the Android framework. The class is used by the `ActivityOptionsCompat` class to provide a way to store and manipulate `Bundle` objects that are used to pass data between activities.</s>

The `Builder` class has several methods that allow you to set various properties of the notification, such as the title, text, icon, and sound. You can also add actions to the notification, such as buttons or links.

Here's a brief overview of the methods in the `Builder` class:

* `setWhen(long when)`: Sets the timestamp for the notification.
* `setUsesChronometer(boolean b)`: Sets whether the notification should use a chronometer to display the elapsed time since the notification was posted.
* `setSmallIcon(int icon)`: Sets the small icon for the notification.
* `setSmallIcon(int icon, int level)`: Sets the small icon for the notification and the notification level.
* `setContentTitle(CharSequence title)`: Sets the title for the notification.
* `setContentText(CharSequence text)`: Sets the text for the notification.
* `setSubText(CharSequence text)`: Sets the subtext for the notification.
* `setNumber(int number)`: Sets the number for the notification.
* `setContentInfo(CharSequence info)`: Sets the content info for the notification.
* `setProgress(int max, int progress, boolean indeterminate)`: Sets the progress for the notification.
* `setContent(RemoteViews views)`: Sets the content for the notification.
* `setContentIntent(PendingIntent intent)`: Sets the content intent for the notification.
* `setDeleteIntent(PendingIntent intent)`: Sets the delete intent for the notification.
* `setFullScreenIntent(PendingIntent intent, boolean highPriority)`: Sets the full screen intent for the notification.
* `setTicker(CharSequence tickerText)`: Sets the ticker text for the notification.
* `setTicker(CharSequence tickerText, RemoteViews views)`: Sets the ticker text and the ticker view for the notification.
* `setLargeIcon(Bitmap icon)`: Sets the large icon for the notification.
* `setSound(Uri sound)`: Sets the sound for the notification.
* `setSound(Uri sound, int streamType)`: Sets the sound and the stream type for the notification.
* `setVibrate(long[] pattern)`: Sets the vibrate pattern for the notification.
* `setLights(int argb, int onMs, int offMs)`: Sets the lights for the notification.
* `setOngoing(boolean ongoing)`: Sets whether the notification is ongoing.
* `setOnlyAlertOnce(boolean onlyAlertOnce)`: Sets whether the notification should only alert once.
* `setAutoCancel(boolean autoCancel)`: Sets whether the notification should be automatically canceled.
* `setDefaults(int defaults)`: Sets the default values for the notification.

This is a Java class that extends the `Fragment` class and implements the `DialogInterface.OnCancelListener` and `DialogInterface.OnDismissListener` interfaces. It is used to create a dialog fragment that can be used to display a dialog.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The class is declared as `public class DialogFragment extends Fragment implements DialogInterface.OnCancelListener, DialogInterface.OnDismissListener`. This means that it is a subclass of the `Fragment` class and implements the `OnCancelListener` and `OnDismissListener` interfaces.
2. The class has several private static final variables that are used to save the state of the dialog fragment. These variables include `SAVED_BACK_STACK_ID`, `SAVED_CANCELABLE`, `SAVED_DIALOG_STATE_TAG`, `SAVED_SHOWS_DIALOG`, `SAVED_STYLE`, and `SAVED_THEME`.
3. The class has several instance variables that are used to store the state of the dialog fragment. These variables include `mDialog`, `mDismissed`, `mShownByMe`, `mViewDestroyed`, `mStyle`, `mTheme`, `mCancelable`, `mShowsDialog`, and `mBackStackId`.
4. The class has several methods that are used to create and manage the dialog fragment. These methods include `setStyle()`, `show()`, `dismiss()`, `getDialog()`, `getTheme()`, `setCancelable()`, `isCancelable()`, `setShowsDialog()`, `getShowsDialog()`, `onAttach()`, `onDetach()`, `onCreate()`, `onSaveInstanceState()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroyView()`.
5. The `onCreateDialog()` method is used to create the dialog that will be displayed by the dialog fragment. This method returns a new `Dialog` object with the theme and style specified by the `mTheme` and `mStyle` instance variables.
6. The `onCancel()` and `onDismiss()` methods are used to handle the `OnCancelListener` and `OnDismissListener` events, respectively. These methods do nothing by default, but can be overridden by subclasses to handle these events.
7. The `onActivityCreated()` method is used to set up the dialog fragment after it has been created. This method sets the dialog's owner activity to the current activity, sets the dialog's cancelable flag to the value of the `mCancelable` instance variable, and sets the dialog's on cancel and on dismiss listeners to the current object. It also restores the dialog's state if it was previously saved.
8. The `onStart()` method is used to display the dialog fragment. This method shows the dialog if the `mShowsDialog` instance variable is set to `true`.
9. The `onSaveInstanceState()` method is used to save the state of the dialog fragment. This method saves the dialog's state if it was previously created, and saves the `mStyle`, `mTheme`, `mCancelable`, `mShowsDialog`, and `mBackStackId` instance variables.
10. The `onStop()` method is used to hide the dialog fragment. This method hides the dialog if it was previously created.
11. The `onDestroyView()` method is used to dismiss the dialog fragment. This method dismisses the dialog if it was previously created, and sets the `mDialog` and `mViewDestroyed` instance variables to `null`.</s>

The `DummyTabFactory` class has a private field called `mContext` that is set in the constructor and is used to create a new `View` object when the `createTabContent()` method is called.

The `createTabContent()` method returns a new `View` object with a minimum width and height of 0. This is because the `TabHost` class uses this method to create a new view for each tab, and it needs to be able to determine the size of the view based on the content of the tab.

The `DummyTabFactory` class is used to create a new `View` object for each tab in a `TabHost` widget. The `TabHost` class uses this factory to create a new view for each tab, and it passes the tag of the tab as a parameter to the `createTabContent()` method.

This is a Java class that extends the `FragmentPagerAdapter` class provided by the Android Support Library. It is designed to be used with a `ViewPager` widget to display a collection of fragments.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class is declared as `abstract`, which means it cannot be instantiated directly. It must be subclassed to provide the necessary implementation.
2. The class has a private field called `mCurTransaction` of type `FragmentTransaction`, which is used to manage the transactions between the fragments.
3. The class has a private field called `mCurrentPrimaryItem` of type `Fragment`, which is used to keep track of the currently displayed fragment.
4. The class has a constructor that takes a `FragmentManager` object as a parameter. This is used to create the `FragmentTransaction` object.
5. The class has an abstract method called `getItem(int position)` that must be implemented by the subclass. This method is used to retrieve the fragment for a given position in the view pager.
6. The class has a method called `startUpdate(ViewGroup container)` that is called when the view pager is first created. It does nothing in this implementation.
7. The class has a method called `instantiateItem(ViewGroup container, int position)` that is called when a new fragment needs to be created. It creates a new fragment using the `getItem(int position)` method, and adds it to the `FragmentTransaction` object. It also sets the fragment's menu visibility and user visible hint to true.
8. The class has a method called `destroyItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)` that is called when a fragment needs to be destroyed. It detaches the fragment from the `FragmentTransaction` object.
9. The class has a method called `setPrimaryItem(ViewGroup container, int position, Object object)` that is called when the primary item in the view pager changes. It sets the menu visibility and user visible hint of the fragment to true if it is the new primary item, and false otherwise.
10. The class has a method called `finishUpdate(ViewGroup container)` that is called when the view pager is finished updating. It commits the `FragmentTransaction` object if it is not null.
11. The class has a method called `isViewFromObject(View view, Object object)` that is used to determine whether a view is associated with a given object. It returns true if the view is associated with the fragment, and false otherwise.
12. The class has a method called `saveState()` that is used to save the state of the view pager. It returns null in this implementation.
13. The class has a method called `restoreState(Parcelable state, ClassLoader loader)` that is used to restore the state of the view pager. It does nothing in this implementation.
14. The class has a method called `getItemId(int position)` that is used to retrieve the ID of the item at a given position in the view pager. It returns the position as a long.
15. The class has a private method called `makeFragmentName(int viewId, long id)` that is used to create a unique name for a fragment. It returns a string in the format ""android:switcher:viewId:id"".

Overall, this class provides a convenient way to manage a collection of fragments in a `ViewPager`. It handles the creation, destruction, and display of the fragments, and provides a simple way to customize the behavior of the view pager.</s>

This is a Java class that extends the `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` class provided by the Android Support Library. The class is designed to be used with a `ViewPager` widget to display a collection of fragments.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class is declared as `abstract`, which means it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it must be subclassed to provide the necessary implementation for the `getItem()` method.
2. The class has several private fields, including `mFragmentManager`, `mCurTransaction`, `mSavedState`, `mFragments`, and `mCurrentPrimaryItem`. These fields are used to manage the fragments displayed by the `ViewPager`.
3. The class has several methods that are required to be implemented by subclasses of `FragmentStatePagerAdapter`. These methods include `startUpdate()`, `instantiateItem()`, `destroyItem()`, `setPrimaryItem()`, `finishUpdate()`, `isViewFromObject()`, `saveState()`, and `restoreState()`.
4. The `getItem()` method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. This method is called by the `ViewPager` to retrieve the fragment to display for a given position.
5. The `startUpdate()`, `instantiateItem()`, `destroyItem()`, `setPrimaryItem()`, and `finishUpdate()` methods are used to manage the fragments displayed by the `ViewPager`. These methods are called by the `ViewPager` to create, update, and destroy fragments as needed.
6. The `isViewFromObject()` method is used to determine whether a given view is associated with a given fragment. This method is called by the `ViewPager` to determine whether a view is associated with a fragment.
7. The `saveState()` and `restoreState()` methods are used to save and restore the state of the fragments displayed by the `ViewPager`. These methods are called by the `ViewPager` to save and restore the state of the fragments.

Overall, this class provides a convenient way to display a collection of fragments in a `ViewPager`. It handles the management of the fragments and their state, allowing developers to focus on implementing the necessary logic for their application.</s>

* `from(Activity launchingActivity)`: Creates a new `IntentBuilder` instance from the given `Activity`.
* `getIntent()`: Returns the `Intent` that was built by the `IntentBuilder`.
* `createChooserIntent()`: Creates a chooser `Intent` that allows the user to choose which app to use to share the content.
* `startChooser()`: Starts the chooser `Intent` that was created by `createChooserIntent()`.
* `setChooserTitle(CharSequence title)`: Sets the title of the chooser.
* `setChooserTitle(int resId)`: Sets the title of the chooser from a resource ID.
* `setType(String mimeType)`: Sets the MIME type of the content being shared.
* `setText(CharSequence text)`: Sets the text of the content being shared.
* `setHtmlText(String htmlText)`: Sets the HTML text of the content being shared.
* `setStream(Uri streamUri)`: Sets the stream of the content being shared.
* `addStream(Uri streamUri)`: Adds a stream to the content being shared.
* `setEmailTo(String[] addresses)`: Sets the email addresses of the recipients.
* `addEmailTo(String address)`: Adds an email address to the recipients.
* `addEmailTo(String[] addresses)`: Adds email addresses to the recipients.
* `setEmailCc(String[] addresses)`: Sets the email addresses of the CC recipients.
* `addEmailCc(String address)`: Adds an email address to the CC recipients.
* `addEmailCc(String[] addresses)`: Adds email addresses to the CC recipients.
* `setEmailBcc(String[] addresses)`: Sets the email addresses of the BCC recipients.
* `addEmailBcc(String address)`: Adds an email address to the BCC recipients.
* `addEmailBcc(String[] addresses)`: Adds email addresses to the BCC recipients.
* `setSubject(String subject)`: Sets the subject of the email.

The `IntentBuilder` class is designed to be used in a fluent style, where each method returns the `IntentBuilder` instance itself, allowing you to chain multiple method calls together. For example:
```
IntentBuilder.from(this)
    .setType(""text/plain"")
    .setText(""Hello, world!"")
