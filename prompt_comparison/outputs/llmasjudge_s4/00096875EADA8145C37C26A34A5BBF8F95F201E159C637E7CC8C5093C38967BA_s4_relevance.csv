No, the code does not contain instances of the malware objective known as Execution.

The class has a field `d` that is a `SparseArray` of `WeakReference` objects, and it has a method `a()` that returns an object of type `Q`. The method `a()` is synchronized and it uses the `Process.myTid()` method to get the current thread ID. It then uses the `SparseArray` to get the `WeakReference` object for the current thread ID, and if it is null, it calls the `c()` method to create a new object of type `Q` and adds it to the `SparseArray`. The `c()` method is also synchronized and it removes any `WeakReference` objects that are null.
