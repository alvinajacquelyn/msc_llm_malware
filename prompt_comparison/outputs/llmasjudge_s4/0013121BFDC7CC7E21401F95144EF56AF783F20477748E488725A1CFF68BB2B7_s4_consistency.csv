This is a generic class named `a` that has a type parameter `D`. It implements an interface named `InterfaceC0000a` with the same type parameter `D`.

The class has several fields and methods:

* `a`: an integer field
* `b`: an instance of `InterfaceC0000a` with the same type parameter `D`
* `c`, `d`, and `e`: boolean fields
* `a(int, InterfaceC0000a<D>)`: a method that takes an integer and an instance of `InterfaceC0000a` and sets the `a` field and the `b` field, respectively. It also checks if there is already a listener registered and throws an exception if so.
* `a(InterfaceC0000a<D>)`: a method that takes an instance of `InterfaceC0000a` and sets the `b` field to the given instance. It also checks if there is already a listener registered and throws an exception if so.
* `a()`: a method that sets the `c` field to `true` and calls the `b()` method.
* `b()`: a protected method that is called by the `a()` method.
* `c()`: a method that sets the `c` field to `false` and calls the `d()` method.
* `d()`: a protected method that is called by the `c()` method.
* `e()`: a method that sets the `e` field to `true`, sets the `c` field to `false`, sets the `d` field to `false`, and sets the `f` field to `false`. It also calls the `f()` method.
* `f()`: a protected method that is called by the `e()` method.
* `a(D)`: a method that takes an instance of `D` and returns a string representation of the object.
* `toString()`: a method that returns a string representation of the object.
* `a(String, FileDescriptor, PrintWriter, String[])`: a method that takes a string, a file descriptor, a print writer, and an array of strings and prints the object's fields and methods to the print writer.

The class is generic, meaning that it can be used with different types of data. The `D` type parameter is used to specify the type of data that the class can handle.</s>

This code defines an interface named `InterfaceC0000a` with a type parameter named `D`. The interface has no methods or fields, but it can be used as a type for other interfaces or classes that implement it.

The `D` type parameter is a placeholder for a specific type that will be used to implement the interface. For example, if you have a class that implements `InterfaceC0000a`, you can specify the type of the `D` parameter in the class definition.

This code is a common pattern in Java programming, and it is used to define interfaces that can be used as a type for other interfaces or classes. It allows for more flexibility in the design of the code, as it allows for the use of different types in different contexts.</s>

This code is a part of the Android Support Library, specifically the v4 library. It defines a class called `LoaderInfo` that is used to manage the state of a `Loader` object.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class `LoaderInfo` has several fields, including `mId`, `mArgs`, `mCallbacks`, `mLoader`, `mHaveData`, `mDeliveredData`, `mData`, `mStarted`, `mReportNextStart`, `mDestroyed`, `mRetaining`, `mRetainingStarted`, `mListenerRegistered`, and `mPendingLoader`.
2. The constructor of `LoaderInfo` takes two arguments: `id` and `args`. The `id` is an integer that uniquely identifies the loader, and the `args` is a `Bundle` that contains any arguments that were passed to the loader.
3. The `a()` method is called when the loader is started. It sets the `mStarted` field to `true` and calls the `a()` method of the `mCallbacks` field, which is an instance of the `LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks` interface.
4. The `b()` method is called when the loader is retained. It sets the `mRetaining` field to `true` and calls the `b()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
5. The `c()` method is called when the loader is finished. It sets the `mRetaining` field to `false` and calls the `c()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
6. The `d()` method is called when the loader is destroyed. It sets the `mDestroyed` field to `true` and calls the `d()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
7. The `e()` method is called when the loader is reset. It sets the `mHaveData` field to `false` and calls the `e()` method of the `mCallbacks` field.
8. The `a(android.support.v4.a.a<Object> aVar, Object obj)` method is called when the loader has finished loading data. It sets the `mHaveData` field to `true` and calls the `a()` method of the `mCallbacks` field, passing in the `aVar` and `obj` arguments.

Overall, this class is used to manage the state of a `Loader` object and to communicate with the `LoaderManager` that created it.</s>

This code defines a custom `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class that extends the Android `FrameLayout` class. The class is designed to prevent the view hierarchy from saving the state of the views in the layout.

The `a` method is a static factory method that creates a new `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` instance and adds the given `view` to it. The method sets the layout parameters of the `view` to `FrameLayout.LayoutParams(-1, -1)`, which means that the view will not be saved in the layout state.

The `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class overrides the `dispatchSaveInstanceState` and `dispatchRestoreInstanceState` methods to prevent the view hierarchy from saving and restoring the state of the views in the layout. Instead, the `dispatchFreezeSelfOnly` and `dispatchThawSelfOnly` methods are called, which do not save or restore the state of the views.

The `NoSaveStateFrameLayout` class is used to create a new layout that does not save the state of the views in it. This can be useful when you want to create a layout that does not save the state of its views, such as a layout that contains a view that is not intended to be saved.</s>

This code defines a class called `SavedState` that implements the `Parcelable` interface. The class has a single constructor that takes a `Parcel` object and a `ClassLoader` object as parameters. The constructor reads the contents of the `Parcel` object and stores them in a `Bundle` object called `a`. If the `ClassLoader` object is not null, it sets the class loader of the `Bundle` object to the `ClassLoader` object.

The `SavedState` class also defines a static `CREATOR` field that is an instance of a `Parcelable.Creator` class. The `CREATOR` field has two methods: `createFromParcel` and `newArray`. The `createFromParcel` method creates a new instance of the `SavedState` class by reading the contents of the `Parcel` object passed to it. The `newArray` method creates an array of `SavedState` objects.

The `SavedState` class also defines two methods: `describeContents` and `writeToParcel`. The `describeContents` method returns 0, indicating that the class does not contain any special contents that need to be saved. The `writeToParcel` method writes the contents of the `Bundle` object called `a` to the `Parcel` object passed to it.

In summary, the `SavedState` class is a helper class that is used to save the state of a `Parcelable` object. It reads the contents of a `Parcel` object and stores them in a `Bundle` object, and it provides a way to create new instances of the `SavedState` class from a `Parcel` object.</s>

This is a generic class that implements the `Parcelable.Creator` interface. It takes a type parameter `T` and has a field `a` of type `b<T>`. The class has two methods: `createFromParcel` and `newArray`.

The `createFromParcel` method takes a `Parcel` object as an argument and returns an object of type `T`. This method calls the `a` method of the `b<T>` field, passing in the `Parcel` object and `null` as the second argument. The `a` method is a method of the `b<T>` class that is responsible for creating an object of type `T` from a `Parcel` object.

The `newArray` method takes an integer argument `i` and returns an array of type `T[]`.

This code defines a method called `a` that takes two parameters: `obj` and `sb`. The method is defined as static, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

The method first checks if `obj` is null. If it is, it appends the string ""null"" to the `sb` parameter and returns.

If `obj` is not null, the method gets the simple name of the class of `obj` using the `getClass()` method. If the simple name is null or empty, it gets the full class name of `obj` using the `getName()` method and extracts the simple name by removing everything before the last dot (`.`) character.

The method then appends the simple name to the `sb` parameter and appends an opening curly brace (`{`) to indicate the start of the object's properties.

Finally, the method appends the object's hash code to the `sb` parameter using the `Integer.toHexString()` method and returns.

This code defines a custom `Writer` class called `b` that extends the `Writer` class in Java. The class has a private field called `a` of type `String`, and a private field called `b` of type `StringBuilder`. The constructor takes a `String` parameter called `str` and assigns it to the `a` field.

The `close()`, `flush()`, and `write()` methods are overridden to perform specific actions. The `close()` method calls the `a()` method, which deletes the contents of the `b` field. The `flush()` method also calls the `a()` method.

The `write()` method takes a `char[]` parameter called `cArr`, an `int` parameter called `i`, and an `int` parameter called `i2`. It iterates over the characters in the `cArr` array, starting at index `i`, and appends each character to the `b` field. If the character is a newline (`\n`), it calls the `a()` method. Otherwise, it appends the character to the `b` field.

The `a()` method deletes the contents of the `b` field and logs the contents of the `b` field to the Android log.

This is a Java class that implements a map data structure called a ""hash table"". A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It is called a ""hash table"" because it uses a hash function to ""hash"" the keys, which is a way of converting them into a numerical index that can be used to access the corresponding value in the table.

The class is generic, meaning that it can be used to store values of any type. The type of the values is specified by the type parameter ""E"".

The class has several methods:

* `a(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns `null`.
* `a(int i, E e)`: Associates the value `e` with the key `i`. If there is already a value associated with `i`, returns the old value.
* `b(int i)`: Removes the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `c(int i)`: Removes all values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `d(int i)`: Returns the number of values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns 0.
* `a()`: Returns the total number of values in the map.
* `e(int i)`: Returns the key associated with the value at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns -1.
* `f(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns `null`.
* `b()`: Removes all values from the map.

The class also has several private methods:

* `c()`: Resizes the map by doubling the size of the arrays used to store the keys and values.
* `a(int i, E e)`: Associates the value `e` with the key `i`. If there is already a value associated with `i`, returns the old value.
* `b(int i)`: Removes the value associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `c(int i)`: Removes all values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, does nothing.
* `d(int i)`: Returns the number of values associated with the key `i`. If there is no value associated with `i`, returns 0.
* `a()`: Returns the total number of values in the map.
* `e(int i)`: Returns the key associated with the value at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns -1.
* `f(int i)`: Returns the value associated with the key at index `i` in the map. If there is no value at index `i`, returns `null`.
* `b()`: Removes all values from the map.

The class also has several private fields:

* `a`: A constant object used to represent the absence of a value.
* `b`: A boolean indicating whether the map needs to be resized.
* `c`: An array of integers used to store the keys.
* `d`: An array of objects used to store the values.
* `e`: The number of values in the map.

The class also has several static methods:

* `g(int i)`: Returns the next power of 2 greater than or equal to `i`.
* `h(int i)`: Returns the number of elements that can be stored in a hash table with a load factor of 0.75 and a size of `i`.</s>

This code defines a class called `i` that has a static method called `a`. The method takes a `TextView` object as an argument and sets a transformation method on it.

The transformation method is a custom class called `a` that extends `SingleLineTransformationMethod`. This class overrides the `getTransformation` method to convert the text to uppercase.

The `getTransformation` method takes two arguments: `charSequence` and `view`. It returns a transformed version of the `charSequence` argument, which is the text to be transformed.

The transformation is done by calling the `toUpperCase` method on the `charSequence` argument, passing in the `Locale` object of the current context. This ensures that the text is transformed to uppercase in the current locale.

The `a` class also has a private constructor that takes a `Context` object as an argument. This constructor sets the `Locale` object of the current context to a private field called `a`.

The `a` class also has a private static field called `TAG` that is used for logging purposes.

This code defines a class named `o` with two static methods: `a` and `a`.

The `a` method takes two parameters: `view` and `i`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the `view` can scroll horizontally in the direction specified by `i`.

The `a` method is overloaded, meaning it has multiple definitions for the same method name. The first definition takes a `View` object and an `int` parameter, and returns a boolean value. The second definition takes a `View` object and an `Object` parameter, and sets the accessibility delegate of the `view` to the specified object.

The class is not intended to be instantiated, and the methods are not intended to be called directly. They are used as utility methods to perform certain actions on a `View` object.</s>

This code defines a custom view called `PagerTabStrip` that extends the `PagerTitleStrip` class. It adds a few new features to the `PagerTitleStrip` class, including the ability to draw a full underline at the bottom of the strip, and the ability to change the color of the tab indicator.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class definition starts with `public class PagerTabStrip extends PagerTitleStrip {`. This defines the class as a subclass of `PagerTitleStrip`.
2. The class contains several private static final variables that define the heights of various elements of the tab strip. These include the height of the full underline, the height of the tab indicator, the minimum padding at the bottom of the strip, the minimum height of the strip, and the minimum spacing between tabs.
3. The class also contains several private instance variables that define the current state of the tab strip. These include the current color of the tab indicator, the current position of the tab indicator, and the current height of the tab indicator.
4. The class constructor sets up the instance variables and calls the superclass constructor. It also sets up the touch listener for the tab strip.
5. The `setTabIndicatorColor()` method sets the color of the tab indicator. It also invalidates the tab strip to redraw it with the new color.
6. The `setTabIndicatorColorResource()` method sets the color of the tab indicator using a resource ID. It calls the `setTabIndicatorColor()` method with the color value.
7. The `getTabIndicatorColor()` method returns the current color of the tab indicator.
8. The `setPadding()` method overrides the superclass method to ensure that the padding at the bottom of the strip is at least as large as the height of the tab indicator.
9. The `setTextSpacing()` method overrides the superclass method to ensure that the spacing between tabs is at least as large as the minimum spacing defined in the class.
10. The `setBackgroundDrawable()` method overrides the superclass method to set the background of the tab strip to a specific drawable.
11. The `setBackgroundColor()` method overrides the superclass method to set the background of the tab strip to a specific color.
12. The `setBackgroundResource()` method overrides the superclass method to set the background of the tab strip to a specific resource.
13. The `setDrawFullUnderline()` method sets a flag to indicate whether the full underline should be drawn at the bottom of the tab strip.
14. The `getMinHeight()` method overrides the superclass method to ensure that the minimum height of the tab strip is at least as large as the height of the tab indicator.
15. The `onTouchEvent()` method overrides the superclass method to handle touch events on the tab strip. It checks whether the touch event is a tap or a drag, and if it's a tap, it updates the current position of the tab indicator.
16. The `onDraw()` method overrides the superclass method to draw the tab strip. It draws the tab indicator, and if the `drawFullUnderline` flag is set, it also draws a full underline at the bottom of the strip.
17. The `a()` method is called by the superclass when the current page changes. It updates the position of the tab indicator and invalidates the tab strip to redraw it.</s>

This code defines a class named `q` that has a static field named `a` of type `c`. The class also defines two inner classes named `a` and `b` that implement the interface `c`.

The `a` class has a constructor that initializes the `a` field to a new instance of the `a` class. The `a` class also overrides the `a` method of the `c` interface and returns the value of `viewConfiguration.getScaledTouchSlop()`.

The `b` class has a constructor that initializes the `a` field to a new instance of the `b` class. The `b` class also overrides the `a` method of the `c` interface and returns the value of `r.a(viewConfiguration)`.

The `q` class has a static initializer block that checks the version of the Android operating system. If the version is greater than or equal to 11, the `a` field is initialized to a new instance of the `b` class. Otherwise, the `a` field is initialized to a new instance of the `a` class.

The `q` class also defines a static method named `a` that takes a `ViewConfiguration` object as an argument. The method returns the value of the `a` field, which is an instance of the `c` interface. The `a` method of the `c` interface is overridden by both the `a` and `b` classes, and the method returns different values depending on the version of the Android operating system.
