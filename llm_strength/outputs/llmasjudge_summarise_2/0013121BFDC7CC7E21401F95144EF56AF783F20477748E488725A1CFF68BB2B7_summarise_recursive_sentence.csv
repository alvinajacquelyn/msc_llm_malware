The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. The code defines a class called FragmentManagerState that implements the Parcelable interface. It has three fields: a, b, and c, which are arrays of FragmentState, int, and BackStackState objects, respectively. The class has a constructor that takes a Parcel object as an argument and initializes the fields based on the data in the Parcel. It also has a writeToParcel method that writes the data from the fields to the Parcel. This code defines a class called `FragmentState` that implements the `Parcelable` interface. It is used to store the state of a `Fragment` in a `Bundle` and then restore it later. The class has several fields, including `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, and `j`, which represent the name of the fragment class, the fragment's ID, whether the fragment is hidden, the fragment's user ID, the fragment's group ID, the fragment's tag, whether the fragment is detached, whether the fragment is removed, and the fragment's arguments, respectively. The class also has several methods, including `a()`, `writeToParcel()`, and `describeContents()`, which are used to create and write the `FragmentState` object to a `Parcel`, and to describe its contents. This is a Java class named ""g"" that extends another class named ""f"". It has several fields and methods, including a constructor that takes a ""FragmentActivity"" object and a boolean flag as parameters, and several other methods that perform various actions such as starting, stopping, and destroying loaders. The class also has a ""toString()"" method that returns a string representation of the object. The code defines a class named ""h"" that extends the AndroidRuntimeException class and has a single constructor that takes a String parameter. This code defines a custom view group called ""NoSaveStateFrameLayout"" that extends the Android ""FrameLayout"" class. The view group overrides the ""dispatchSaveInstanceState"" and ""dispatchRestoreInstanceState"" methods to prevent the view group from saving and restoring its state. This is useful when you want to create a view group that does not save its state, such as a view group that contains a view that should not be saved. The code defines a class called SavedState that implements the Parcelable interface. It has a final Bundle field called a, and a constructor that takes a Parcel and a ClassLoader as arguments. The constructor reads the Bundle from the Parcel and sets the class loader on the Bundle if necessary. The class also defines a Parcelable.Creator object called CREATOR that is used to create instances of SavedState from a Parcel. This code defines a class named ""a"" that implements the Parcelable.Creator interface. The class has a static method named ""a"" that takes a b<T> object as a parameter and returns a new Parcelable.Creator<T> object. The method checks the Android version and uses the d.a() method if the version is 13 or higher. If the version is lower than 13, the method creates a new C0001a<T> object and returns it. The C0001a<T> class implements the Parcelable.Creator<T> interface and has a final b<T> field named ""a"". The createFromParcel() method of the C0001a<T> class creates a new T object by calling the a() method of the b<T> object with the Parcel and null arguments. The newArray() method of the C0001a<T> class creates a new array of T objects by calling the a() method of the b<T> object with the size of the array as an argument. The code defines an interface named `b` that has two methods: `a` and `a`. The `a` method takes a `Parcel` and a `ClassLoader` as parameters and returns an object of type `T`. The `a` method also takes an `int` as a parameter and returns an array of objects of type `T`. This code defines a class named `c` that implements the `Parcelable.ClassLoaderCreator` interface. The class takes a `b` object as a constructor parameter, and it has three methods: `createFromParcel`, `createFromParcel`, and `newArray`. The `createFromParcel` methods create a new instance of the class by reading data from a `Parcel` object, and the `createFromParcel` method with a `ClassLoader` parameter creates a new instance of the class by reading data from a `Parcel` object and using the specified `ClassLoader` to load any nested classes. The `newArray` method creates a new array of the class.

This is a static class named C0001a that implements the Parcelable.Creator interface. It has a final field of type b, which is a generic type parameter. The class has a constructor that takes a b object as an argument, and it implements the createFromParcel and newArray methods of the Parcelable.Creator interface. The createFromParcel method creates a new instance of the generic type T by calling the a method of the b object, passing in the Parcel object and a null value for the second argument. The newArray method creates a new array of the generic type T by calling the a method of the b object, passing in the size of the array as an argument. The code defines a static method `a` in the `d` class that takes a `b` object as a parameter and returns a `Parcelable.Creator` object. The method creates a new `c` object that wraps the `b` object and returns it. This code defines a method called ""a"" that takes an object and a StringBuilder as input, and appends a string representation of the object to the StringBuilder. The method first checks if the object is null, and if so, appends the string ""null"" to the StringBuilder. If the object is not null, the method gets the simple name of the object's class using the getSimpleName() method, and if the simple name is null or empty, it gets the full name of the class using the getName() method and extracts the simple name by removing everything before the last dot (.). The method then appends the simple name and the object's identity hash code to the StringBuilder. This code defines a custom implementation of the `Writer` class in Java, which allows for writing text to the console. The class has a private field `a` that stores the name of the writer, and a private field `b` that stores a `StringBuilder` object that is used to build the text to be written. The `write` method is overridden to append the given characters to the `StringBuilder` object, and the `close` and `flush` methods are overridden to call the `a` method, which logs the contents of the `StringBuilder` object to the console. This is a Java class named ""c"" that implements a map data structure. It has methods for adding, removing, and retrieving elements, as well as methods for checking the size of the map and iterating over its elements.

The class also has several methods that call the ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", and ""a"" methods on the ""b"" field with different arguments. The ""b"" field is initialized to an instance of either the ""b"" or ""C0002a"" class, depending on the value of the ""Build.VERSION.SDK_INT"" field. This code defines a static class called ""b"" that implements the ""c"" interface. The class has several methods that are used to create, update, and draw an EdgeEffect object. The methods are used to set the size of the EdgeEffect, check if it is finished, and draw it on a canvas. The class also has a static method that creates a new EdgeEffect object. The code defines an interface named ""c"" with several methods, including a method that takes a Context object as a parameter, another method that takes an Object and two integer parameters, a method that takes an Object and a float parameter, a method that takes an Object and a Canvas parameter, a method that takes an Object as a parameter and returns a boolean value, and a method that takes an Object as a parameter and returns a boolean value.

The code defines a class named `ab` with a private static field `a` of type `float` and a public static method `a` that takes a `float` argument and returns the product of `a` and the argument. The method also has a public static method `a` that takes a `Context` argument and sets the value of `a` to the density of the display metrics of the context. Additionally, the class has a public static method `b` that takes a `float` argument and returns the result of rounding the product of `a` and the argument to the nearest integer. This is a Java class named ""ac"" that contains several methods for managing files and directories. The class has private fields for an integer ""a"", an integer ""b"", an integer ""c"", a File ""d"", an ExecutorService ""e"", and an integer ""f"". The class also has several static methods for manipulating files and directories, such as ""b"" and ""d"". The class also has several instance methods for managing files and directories, such as ""a"" and ""a"". This code defines a custom BroadcastReceiver class named ""ad"" that listens for incoming Intents with a specific action. When an Intent is received, the code checks if the Intent contains a specific extra with the key ""cmn.refkey"". If it does, the code retrieves the value of that extra and stores it in a SharedPreferences object. The SharedPreferences object is then edited to add or update the value of the ""cmn.refkey"" key with the retrieved value. Finally, the code calls a method named ""a"" on the ""a"" class, passing in the SharedPreferences Editor object as an argument. This is a Java class that implements the Runnable interface and is used to read data from a file and write it to a cache. The class takes in three parameters: an object, a file path, and a cache object. It then reads the data from the file and writes it to the cache. If the data is not found in the cache, it is read from the file and written to the cache. The class also has a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the read or write process. This code defines a class named ""af"" that implements the ""Runnable"" interface. The class has two fields: ""a"" and ""b"", which are both of type ""Object"". The constructor takes two arguments: ""acVar"" and ""obj"". The ""run"" method is defined, which tries to delete a file with the name specified by the ""a"" field, and catches any exceptions that may occur. This is a Java class that implements the Comparator interface, specifically the compare method. It takes two objects as input and returns an integer value indicating the comparison result. The class has two private fields: a Map object and an ac object. The compare method compares the values of two files in the Map object and returns the result of the comparison. This code defines a class named `ah` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has three fields: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are all of type `Object`. The constructor takes three arguments: `acVar`, `obj`, and `obj2`, which are all of type `Object`. The `run()` method is defined, and it performs the following actions:

1. It creates a new `ObjectOutputStream` using a `FileOutputStream` and writes the `a` and `b` objects to the output stream.
2. It writes the current system time in milliseconds to the output stream.
3. It closes the `ObjectOutputStream`.
4. It calls the `b()` method on the `ac` object, which is passed in as a constructor argument.
5. It sets the `i` variable to the value of the `f` field of the `ac` object.
6. If `i` is less than or equal to 0, it calls the `d()` and `e()` methods on the `ac` object. This is a Java class that defines a static method for creating an instance of the `DefaultHttpClient` class. The method creates a new instance of the `DefaultHttpClient` class if one does not already exist, and returns it. The method also sets various parameters on the `DefaultHttpClient` instance, such as the maximum number of connections, the connection timeout, and the user agent. This is a Java class that implements a method called ""a"" which takes an ImageView and a String as input, and sets the image of the ImageView to the bitmap with the specified string as its URL. The method also takes an optional parameter of type ""aa"" which is a custom class that is not defined in this code snippet. The method first checks if the method is being called on the UI thread, and if not, it throws an IllegalStateException. If the method is being called on the UI thread, it then checks if the ImageView is null, and if so, it returns. Otherwise, it gets the bitmap with the specified string as its URL from a cache, and if it exists, it sets the image of the ImageView to the bitmap and returns. If the bitmap does not exist in the cache, it adds the ImageView to a list of views that are waiting for the bitmap to be downloaded, and it adds the aa object to a list of callbacks that will be called when the bitmap is downloaded. This code defines a class named ""b"" that has a constructor that takes a byte array and a Throwable object as parameters, and two instance variables: a byte array named ""a"" and a Throwable object named ""b"". The class also has a method named ""a"" that returns the byte array.

This code defines a class named `t` that contains several static fields and methods related to base64 encoding and decoding. The class is not intended to be instantiated, and all of its methods are static.

The `a` method takes a byte array and returns a base64-encoded string. The `b` method takes a base64-encoded string and returns a byte array. The `c` field is a boolean that determines whether the `a` and `b` methods should perform assertions to ensure that the input and output are valid.

The `a` method uses a lookup table to convert the input bytes to base64 characters. The `b` method does the reverse, using the same lookup table to convert the base64 characters back to bytes. The `a` method also performs some error checking to ensure that the input is valid.

Overall, this code appears to be a simple implementation of base64 encoding and decoding, with some additional error checking and performance optimizations.

This code defines a class named `u` that extends `LinkedHashMap` and overrides its `get` and `put` methods to use `SoftReference` objects to store the values. The `get` method returns the value associated with the given key, or `null` if the key is not found or the value has been garbage collected. The `put` method stores the value associated with the given key, using a `SoftReference` object to ensure that the value is not garbage collected. The code defines a class named `v` that extends `LinkedHashMap` and has two fields: `a` and `b`. The constructor takes an `u` object and an `int` as parameters and initializes the `b` field with the `u` object.

The code defines an interface named ""b"" with a single method named ""a"" that takes a ""Context"" object as a parameter and returns a ""boolean"" value. The code defines a class named `c` that has two static methods: `a()` and `b()`. The `a()` method returns an instance of `b`, which is a private class defined within `c`. The `b()` method initializes the `b` instance and sets a flag indicating whether the `b` instance has been initialized. The `b()` method also checks whether the `b` instance has been initialized and throws an exception if it has not been initialized. The code defines an interface named ""d"" with two methods: ""a"" with no parameters and ""a"" with a boolean parameter named ""z"".

This code defines a class called ReferrerReceiver that extends BroadcastReceiver. It has a static method called a() that takes a Context object as a parameter and returns a String. The method first calls the a() method of a class called be.a(), which is not defined in this code snippet. It then returns the value of the j() method of the be.a() class. The onReceive() method of the ReferrerReceiver class overrides the onReceive() method of the BroadcastReceiver class and takes a Context object and an Intent object as parameters. It first tries to get the receiverInfo object of the ReferrerReceiver class using the getReceiverInfo() method of the PackageManager class. If the receiverInfo object is null or if its metaData object is null or if its keySet object is null or if its size is 0, it returns. Otherwise, it iterates through the keySet object and adds the values of the keys that start with ""forward."" to an ArrayList object. It then iterates through the ArrayList object and creates a new instance of the class with the name of the value in the ArrayList object using the Class.forName() method and the newInstance() method. If the newInstance object is an instance of BroadcastReceiver, it calls the onReceive() method of the newInstance object with the Context object and Intent object as parameters.

The ""resize"" method is overridden to return a new ""LinearGradient"" object with the specified dimensions and the colors from the ""a"" field. This code defines a custom `ShaderFactory` class named `af` that creates a `RadialGradient` shader with a specific set of colors and positions. The `resize` method of the `ShaderFactory` class is overridden to create a new `RadialGradient` shader with the specified dimensions. The `a` field is a reference to an `x` object, which is not shown in the code snippet. The code defines a custom `ShaderFactory` class named `ag` that creates a `RadialGradient` shader with a specific color palette and gradient size. The `resize` method of the `ShaderFactory` class is overridden to create a new `RadialGradient` shader with the specified size and color palette.

The class also has a nested class named `a` that has several fields and methods, and it also has a nested class named `C0007a` that has several fields and methods. This code defines a class named `ai` that implements the `AppBrainActivity.a` interface. The class has several private fields and methods, but the most important ones are:

* `a`: a private field that stores the activity that the class is associated with.
* `b`: a private field that stores a `WebView` object that is used to display the offerwall.
* `c`: a private field that stores a `ViewGroup` object that is used to display a progress bar while the offerwall is loading.
* `d`: a private field that stores the URL of the offerwall.
* `e`: a private field that stores the URL of the offerwall's landing page.
* `f`: a private field that stores the `Activity` object that the class is associated with.
* `g`: a private field that stores a `ProgressDialog` object that is used to display a progress bar while the offerwall is loading.
* `h`: a private field that stores an `ap` object that is used to handle the offerwall's JavaScript events.
* `a(j.f)`: a method that is called when the offerwall is loaded. It takes a `j.f` object as a parameter and uses it to set the URL of the offerwall.
* `a()`: a method that is called when the offerwall is closed. It dismisses the progress bar and sets the `a` field to `j.h.UNKNOWN_SOURCE`.
* `a(Bundle)`: a method that is called when the offerwall is reloaded. It takes a `Bundle` object as a parameter and uses it to set the URL of the offerwall.
* `b(int)`: a method that is called when the user clicks on a link in the offerwall. It takes an `int` parameter that represents the ID of the link and returns `true` if the link was clicked, or `false` otherwise.
* `c()`: a method that is called when the offerwall is skipped. It returns `true` if the offerwall was skipped, or `false` otherwise.
* `d()`: a method that is called when the offerwall is closed. It disables JavaScript in the `WebView` object and sets the `a` field to `j.h.UNKNOWN_SOURCE`. This code defines a custom WebViewClient class named ""aj"" that overrides the ""onReceivedError"" and ""shouldOverrideUrlLoading"" methods of the WebViewClient class. The ""onReceivedError"" method loads a custom error page with a message and a link to try again, while the ""shouldOverrideUrlLoading"" method throws an UnsupportedOperationException. This code defines a class named ""ak"" that contains various static methods for working with the Android platform. The class is marked as ""final"" and has a private constructor, indicating that it is not intended to be extended or subclassed. The code defines several methods for working with web views, such as ""a(Context, WebView)"" and ""a(Context, String, String, String)"". It also defines a method for tracking clicks on links, ""trackClick(String, String, String)"", and a method for reporting that a package has been installed or uninstalled, ""reportSelected(String, String, String)"". The code also defines a method for clearing the cache of a web view, ""a(Context, WebView)"". This is an Android AsyncTask class that takes a string and a context as input, and performs an HTTP request to the specified URL. The task uses a loop to follow redirects and returns the final URL. If the final URL is not a valid HTTP response, the task returns null. The task also logs any exceptions that occur during the request. This code defines a class named `am` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has four instance variables: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are all strings. The constructor takes four arguments: `aVar`, `str`, `str2`, and `str3`, which are all strings. The `run()` method is defined, which performs a series of operations on the instance variables. It first checks if the activity is in the foreground, and if it is, it splits the `a` string into an array of strings and iterates over the array, checking if each string is in the foreground. If it is, it calls the `j.b()` method with the string. It then splits the `b` string into an array of strings and iterates over the array, calling the `j.a()` method with each string. Finally, it calls the `j.c()` method with the `c` string.

The class has several methods that are not shown in the code snippet, but they are related to the implementation of the ""a"" interface. This code defines a custom `WebViewClient` class called `ar` that overrides the `onPageFinished`, `onPageStarted`, and `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` methods. The `onPageFinished` method is called when a page has finished loading, and it sets the visibility of a `ProgressBar` to `8` (invisible). The `onPageStarted` method is called when a page starts loading, and it sets the visibility of the `ProgressBar` to `0` (visible) if the page is not already being loaded by another `WebViewClient`. The `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` method is called when the user clicks on a link, and it returns `true` if the link should be loaded by the current `WebViewClient`, or `false` if it should be loaded by another `WebViewClient`. This is a Java abstract class named ""as"" that defines a set of methods for checking for updates in an Android application. The class has several private fields, including a string for the last check time, a string for the last error time, and a string for the error count. It also has a final field for the update interval, which is set in the constructor. The class has a method for checking for updates, which takes a context and a shared preferences object as arguments. If the update check is successful, the method will update the shared preferences with the new check time and error count. The class also has a method for getting the shared preferences, which is used in the update check method. The class is abstract, which means it cannot be instantiated directly. It is intended to be subclassed by other classes that can perform the actual update check. This is a Java class that implements the Runnable interface and has a constructor that takes in an instance of the class ""as"" and a context, as well as two long values and a SharedPreferences object. The class has a final field ""d"" that is set to the instance of ""as"" passed in the constructor, and it also has final fields for the context, the two long values, and the SharedPreferences object. The class has an overridden ""run"" method that tries to call the ""a"" method on the instance of ""as"" passed in the constructor, and if that fails, it catches the exception and tries to call the ""a"" method again with a different set of parameters. The method also sets a boolean value to false using an AtomicBoolean object. This is a Java class named ""au"" that contains several static methods for working with AppBrain, a mobile app analytics platform. The class is marked as ""final"" and is not intended to be extended or subclassed. The methods in the class include ""a"", ""a"", and ""b"", which are used to send events to AppBrain, retrieve events from AppBrain, and check if a user has seen a particular event, respectively. The class also includes a ""d"" method that is used to retrieve a SharedPreferences object that is used to store events. This is a Java class named ""av"" that extends a class named ""c"" from a package named ""com.appbrain.f"". It has a private static variable named ""b"" of type ""av"" and a private final variable named ""c"" of type ""ap"". The constructor takes a ""Context"" object and an ""a"" object as parameters and initializes the ""c"" variable with a new ""aw"" object. The ""a"" method is a static method that returns an instance of the ""av"" class, and it synchronizes on the class object to ensure that only one instance is created. The ""a"" method takes a ""Context"" object and a ""String"" parameter and returns an instance of the ""av"" class. The ""a"" method is overridden from the parent class to return a new ""a.C0018a.C0019a"" object. This is a Java class named ""aw"" that extends the ""ap"" class and has a final field named ""a"" of type ""av"". The constructor takes an ""av"" object and a ""Context"" object as parameters and initializes the ""a"" field with the ""av"" object. The ""a"" method overrides the ""a"" method of the ""ap"" class and takes two parameters of type ""m.a"" and ""h.a"". The method casts the first parameter to ""a.k.C0015a"" and calls the ""a"" method on it with the second parameter.

The class has a single constructor that takes a `bp` object as a parameter, and a `run()` method that calls the `a()` method on the `bp` object. This code defines a class called `br` that implements the `View.OnKeyListener` interface. The class has two fields: `a` and `b`, which are both of type `long` and `bp`, respectively. The constructor takes two arguments: `bpVar` and `j`, which are both of type `bp` and `long`, respectively. The `onKey` method is overridden to check if the key pressed is not equal to 4, and if it is, it returns `false`. If the key pressed is equal to 4, it checks if the elapsed real-time is greater than or equal to 1500 milliseconds since the last time the key was pressed, and if it is, it calls the `a` method on the `bp` object. The `a` method is not defined in the code snippet provided, but it is likely to be a method that performs some action when the key is pressed. This code defines a class named ""bs"" that implements the ""j.c"" interface. The class has two methods: ""a"" and ""b"". The ""a"" method returns a ViewGroup object, while the ""b"" method returns a ViewGroup object. The ""a"" method creates a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and padding, and adds three views to it: a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and weight, a View object, and a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and weight. The ""b"" method creates a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and padding, and adds five views to it: a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and weight, a View object, a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and weight, a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and weight, and a LinearLayout object with a specific orientation and weight.

This code defines a class named C0006a that has two final fields, a and b, and a private constructor that takes two integers. The class also has two static methods, a and a, that create a new instance of C0006a based on the current stack trace and an Intent, respectively. The a method uses the getStackTrace method to get the current stack trace and then iterates through the elements, skipping any elements that belong to the same class as the C0006a class. It then returns a new instance of C0006a with the hash code of the first non-C0006a class in the stack trace and the hash code of the StringBuffer object. The a method also has an overloaded version that takes an Intent as a parameter and returns a new instance of C0006a with the hash code of the ""hash_last"" extra in the Intent and the hash code of the ""hash"" extra in the Intent. The b method takes an Intent as a parameter and puts the hash code of the ""hash_last"" extra in the Intent and the hash code of the ""hash"" extra in the Intent.

This code defines a class named `d` that implements the `g` interface. The class has a single method named `a` that takes a `Context` and a `String` as input and returns a `View` object. The method creates a `LinearLayout` object and sets its orientation to horizontal. It then adds several child views to the `LinearLayout`, including an `ImageView`, a `TextView`, and an `ImageButton`. The `ImageView` displays an image, the `TextView` displays a title and a description, and the `ImageButton` displays a button with a gradient background. The `d` class also defines a `ShaderFactory` class named `e` that creates a gradient shader for the `ImageButton`.

The class has a single method named `a` that takes a `Context`, a `String`, a `String`, an `e` object, an `int`, and a `View.OnClickListener` as parameters. The method creates a `LinearLayout` and sets its orientation to vertical. It then creates a `cmn.x` object and sets its text, text size, and padding. It also sets the text color and adds the `cmn.x` object to the `LinearLayout`. It then creates a `cmn.w` object and sets its text, text size, and padding. It also sets the text color and adds the `cmn.w` object to the `LinearLayout`. Finally, it returns the `LinearLayout`. This code defines a class called `i` that implements the `c` interface. The class has a single method called `a` that takes several parameters and returns a `View` object. The method creates a `LinearLayout` object and sets its orientation to horizontal. It then creates two `TextView` objects and adds them to the `LinearLayout`.

(start)
The code defines a class named `k` that implements the `g` interface. The class has a single method named `a` that takes a `Context`, a `String`, a `String`, a `String`, an `e` object, and a `View.OnClickListener` as parameters. The method returns a `LinearLayout` object that contains an `ImageView`, a `LinearLayout` object that contains two `TextView` objects, and an `ImageButton` object. The `ImageButton` object has a gradient background that is created using a `ShapeDrawable.ShaderFactory` object. The `ShapeDrawable.ShaderFactory` object is defined as a nested class within the `k` class and has a single method named `resize` that takes an `int` and an `int` as parameters and returns a `LinearGradient` object. The `LinearGradient` object is created using the `bx.j` object, an `int` value, and an `e` object. The code defines a class named ""l"" that extends the ""ShapeDrawable.ShaderFactory"" class. The class has two fields: ""a"" of type ""bx.e"" and ""b"" of type ""bx.k"". The constructor takes two parameters: ""kVar"" of type ""bx.k"" and ""eVar"" of type ""bx.e"". The ""resize"" method overrides the parent method and returns a new ""LinearGradient"" object with the specified parameters. This is a Java class named ""m"" that contains a number of methods and fields related to displaying a banner ad. The class is defined in the ""com.appbrain.d"" package and is a subclass of the ""AppBrainBanner"" class.

The class has several fields, including ""j"", ""k"", ""m"", ""r"", ""i"", ""l"", ""n"", ""a"", ""b"", ""o"", ""p"", and ""q"". These fields are used to store information about the banner ad, such as its size, position, and content.

The class also has several methods, including the constructor ""m(AppBrainBanner appBrainBanner)"", which is used to initialize the banner ad, and the method ""b()"", which is used to display the banner ad.

The class also has several inner classes, including the ""n"" class, which is used to handle the banner ad's click event, and the ""r"" class, which is used to handle the banner ad's impression event. This code defines a class named `n` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has two final fields: `a` and `b`. The constructor takes two arguments: `mVar` and `dVar`. The `run()` method is defined, which creates a new instance of `AppBrainBanner` and passes it to the `a()` method of the `bv` class, along with a new instance of `o`. This code defines a class named `o` that implements the `cmn.aa` interface. The class has a single field named `a` of type `n`, and a constructor that takes a single argument of type `n`. The class also defines a method named `a` that takes an `Object` argument and overrides the `a` method of the `cmn.aa` interface. The method checks if the argument is null or has a length of 0, and if so, it sets the field `a` to false. Otherwise, it sets the field `a` to the result of calling the `m.a` method with the field `b` and the argument `bVar`. This is a Java class that implements the View.OnClickListener interface. It has a constructor that takes in several parameters, including a reference to a View.OnClickListener object, a String, a j.b object, a String, and an int. The onClick method is overridden to perform some actions, including calling the onClick method of the View.OnClickListener object, and then performing some additional actions. This code defines a class named ""q"" that implements the ""OnClickListener"" interface. The class has three fields: ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"". The ""a"" field is an integer, the ""b"" field is a string, and the ""c"" field is an instance of the ""m"" class. The class also has a constructor that takes three parameters: an instance of the ""m"" class, an integer, and a string. The ""onClick"" method is overridden to call the ""a"" method of the ""AppBrainBanner"" class, passing in the context, the integer value of ""a"", and the string value of ""b"". If the ""l"" field of the ""m"" class is not null, the method also calls the ""a"" method of the ""d"" class, passing in the ""l"" field as a parameter. This code is a part of a class that implements a listener for a button click event. It sets the value of a boolean variable to true if the button has focus, and then calls a method on the class to handle the button click event. This code defines a class named `s` that is a subclass of `h.a`. It overrides the `a()` method and performs a number of operations before returning the result. The operations include retrieving various values from the `Context` object, such as the package name and the version code, as well as retrieving the current time and the current time zone offset. The method also checks for the presence of a referrer and adds it to the data to be sent. Finally, it returns the data as a `h.a` object. This is a Java class that defines a static method for tracking conversions in an Android app. The method takes a `Context` object and an `Intent` object as parameters, and it uses the `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream` classes to read and write data to a file on the device's internal storage. The method also uses the `ArrayList` class to store the conversion events.

This code defines a class called ""u"" with a nested enum called ""a"" that represents the different sizes of images available on Google Photos. The class also has a static method called ""a"" that takes a string, an integer, and an instance of the ""a"" enum as input and returns a string that represents the URL of the image with the specified size. The method first parses the input string as a URI and extracts the host name. If the host name ends with ""ggpht.com"", it assumes that the input string is a Google Photos URL and tries to build a new URI with the specified size. If the input string is not a Google Photos URL or the size is not valid, the method returns the original input string. This code defines a class named `v` that contains a static method named `a` that takes two parameters: `i` and `str`. The method returns a string based on the value of `i` and the language code `str`.

The method first checks if `str` is equal to ""iw"" or ""in"". If it is, it sets `str` to ""he"" or `AnalyticsEvent.EVENT_ID`, respectively.

Next, the method retrieves a string array named `strArr` from a map named `b` based on the value of `str`. If `strArr` is null, it sets it to the default string array named `a`.

Finally, the method returns the string at index `i` in `strArr`. If `strArr` is null or the index is out of bounds, it returns the string at index `i` in the default string array named `a`. This is a Java class that contains a static method for sending data to a server. The method takes a `Context` object and a `String` as input, and it sends the data to a server using the `Intent` class. The data is sent in the form of a `String` and it is appended to a `StringBuilder` object. The `StringBuilder` object is then converted to a `String` and sent to the server. The method also includes a check to ensure that the data is sent at most once every 30 seconds, and it uses a random number to determine whether the data should be sent or not. This is a Java class that implements the AppBrainActivity.a interface. It has a number of private fields and methods, but the main functionality of the class is to display a message to the user when the user clicks on an ad. The message is displayed in a popup window, and it includes a button that allows the user to close the popup. The class also includes a number of other methods that are required by the AppBrainActivity.a interface, but they are not relevant to the main functionality of the class. This code defines a class named `y` that implements the `View.OnClickListener` interface. The `y` class has a constructor that takes an instance of `x` as a parameter, and it has a `onClick` method that is called when the view is clicked. The `onClick` method performs a series of actions, including calling the `a` method on the `x` instance, setting a string variable to the value of the `d` field of the `x` instance, and calling the `a` method on the `x` instance again. The `onClick` method also finishes the activity. This code defines a class named `z` that implements the `ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener` interface. The class has two fields: `a` of type `Button` and `b` of type `x`. The constructor takes two arguments: `xVar` of type `x` and `button` of type `Button`. The `onGlobalLayout` method is defined, which gets called when the global layout of the view tree changes. The method first creates a new `Rect` object and then checks if the `Button` is visible in the current view tree. If it is, the method calls the `a` method of `x` with the center X and Y coordinates of the `Button` as arguments. This code defines a class named ""l"" that implements the ""a"" interface. The class has several methods, including a constructor, a ""c"" method, and an ""a"" method that returns a byte. The class also has a nested class named ""AbstractC0008a"" that implements the ""m"" interface. The code also defines several other classes and interfaces, including ""a"" and ""n"".
