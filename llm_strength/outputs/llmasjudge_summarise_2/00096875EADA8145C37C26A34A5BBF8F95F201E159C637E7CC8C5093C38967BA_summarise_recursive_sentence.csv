The code defines a class named ""d"" that implements the ""Parcelable.Creator"" interface, which is used to create objects of type ""BackStackState"" from a Parcel object. The ""createFromParcel"" method is called to create a new ""BackStackState"" object from the Parcel, and the ""newArray"" method is called to create an array of ""BackStackState"" objects with the specified size. The code defines a class named ""e"" that implements an interface named ""k"". The class has a final field named ""a"" of type ""Fragment"", and a constructor that takes a ""Fragment"" object as an argument and assigns it to the ""a"" field.

The code defines a class named ""f"" that extends the ""RuntimeException"" class. The constructor of the ""f"" class takes two parameters: a string ""str"" and an exception ""exc"". The constructor calls the superclass constructor with the two parameters, which initializes the exception with the specified message and cause. This code defines a class called Fragment, which is a part of the Android framework. The class is a base class for all fragments in an Android app, and it provides a number of methods for managing the fragment's lifecycle and interacting with other parts of the app.

The class has a number of fields and methods, including:

* Constructors: There are two constructors for the class, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a Bundle as an argument.
* Fields: The class has a number of fields, including a Bundle called ""h"" that stores the fragment's state, a boolean called ""F"" that indicates whether the fragment is currently added to the activity, and a boolean called ""N"" that indicates whether the fragment has been started.
* Methods: The class has a number of methods, including a constructor that takes a Context and a String as arguments, a method called ""a"" that returns the fragment's view, a method called ""b"" that returns the fragment's animation, and a method called ""c"" that returns the fragment's view state.

Overall, the Fragment class is a key part of the Android framework, and it provides a way for developers to create and manage fragments in their apps. The code defines a class called FragmentManagerState that implements the Parcelable interface. It has three fields: a, b, and c, which are arrays of FragmentState, int, and BackStackState objects, respectively. The class has a constructor that takes a Parcel object as an argument and initializes the fields based on the data in the Parcel. It also has a writeToParcel method that writes the data from the fields to the Parcel. This is a Java class named ""FragmentState"" that implements the Parcelable interface. It is used to save the state of a Fragment object, which is a component of an Android app that can display content and handle user input. The class has several fields and methods, including a constructor that takes a Parcel object and a method called ""a"" that takes a FragmentManager object and a Fragment object and returns a new Fragment object with the saved state. The code defines a custom class called `FragmentTabHost` that extends the Android `TabHost` class and adds support for using fragments in tabs. It also implements the `TabHost.OnTabChangeListener` interface to listen for changes to the currently selected tab. The class has several private fields and methods, including a `SavedState` class that is used to save and restore the state of the tab host. The `onAttachedToWindow` method is overridden to set up the tab host and its tabs, and the `onDetachedFromWindow` method is overridden to clean up the tab host and its tabs. The `onTabChanged` method is also overridden to update the currently selected tab and notify any listeners. The code defines a class named `g` that implements the `Parcelable.Creator` interface for the `Fragment.SavedState` class. The `createFromParcel` method creates a new `Fragment.SavedState` object from a `Parcel` object, and the `newArray` method creates a new array of `Fragment.SavedState` objects. The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. The code defines a class named ""i"" with a static final array named ""a"" that contains the values of the attributes ""name"", ""id"", and ""tag"" from the Android framework. The code defines a class named `j` that has four fields: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The `c` field is of type `android.support.v4.c.l<String,Object>`, which is a generic class that takes two type parameters. The `d` field is of type `ArrayList<Fragment>`, which is a class that represents a list of `Fragment` objects. The `e` field is of type `android.support.v4.c.l<String,y>`, which is a generic class that takes two type parameters. The code defines an interface named ""k"" with a single method named ""a"" that takes an integer ""i"" as a parameter and returns a ""View"" object.

This is a Java class that implements the Map interface. It has a field called ""a"" that is an instance of the class ""b"". The class ""b"" is a private inner class that extends the class ""f"" and implements the Map interface. The class ""a"" overrides the methods of the Map interface and delegates the implementation to the instance of ""b"". The methods ""putAll"" and ""values"" are implemented by calling the corresponding methods on the instance of ""b"". This code defines a class called ""b"" that extends the ""f"" class and overrides some of its methods. The class has a field called ""a"" that is an instance of the ""a"" class, and it has a constructor that takes an ""a"" object as a parameter. The class overrides the ""a"" method to return the value of the ""h"" field of the ""a"" object, and it overrides the ""a"" method to return the value of the ""a"" method of the ""a"" object. It also overrides the ""a"" method to return the value of the ""g"" field of the ""a"" object, and it overrides the ""a"" method to return the value of the ""a"" method of the ""a"" object. It also overrides the ""a"" method to return the value of the ""d"" method of the ""a"" object. It also overrides the ""a"" method to return the value of the ""put"" method of the ""a"" object. It also overrides the ""a"" method to return the value of the ""clear"" method of the ""a"" object. This is a Java class named ""c"" that contains several static methods for performing various operations, such as sorting, searching, and comparing objects. The class has three static arrays of different types: int[], long[], and Object[]. The methods in the class use these arrays to perform their operations. This code defines a method called ""a"" that takes an object and a StringBuilder as input, and appends a string representation of the object to the StringBuilder. The method first checks if the object is null, and if so, appends the string ""null"" to the StringBuilder. If the object is not null, the method gets the simple name of the object's class using the getSimpleName() method, and if the simple name is null or empty, it gets the full name of the class using the getName() method and extracts the simple name by removing everything before the last dot (.). The method then appends the simple name and the object's identity hash code to the StringBuilder. This code defines a custom implementation of the `Writer` class in Java, which allows for writing text to a log file. The class has a private field `a` that stores the name of the log file, and a private `StringBuilder` object `b` that is used to build the text to be written to the log file. The `write` method overrides the `Writer` class's `write` method, and takes in a character array `cArr`, an integer `i` that represents the starting index of the character array, and an integer `i2` that represents the number of characters to be written. The method iterates through the character array, appending each character to the `StringBuilder` object `b` if it is not a newline character. If a newline character is encountered, the method calls the `a` method to write the contents of the `StringBuilder` object to the log file. This is a generic class called ""f"" that implements the Map interface. It has three abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass: a(), a(Object), and a(int, int). The class also has several other methods that are used to implement the Map interface, such as containsKey(), containsValue(), and remove(). The class is designed to be used as a base class for other classes that need to implement the Map interface. The code defines a class named ""g"" that implements the Iterator interface. It has a field ""e"" of type ""f"" and two integer fields ""a"" and ""b"". The constructor takes an instance of ""f"" and an integer ""i"" as parameters. The class has three methods: ""hasNext()"" which returns true if the iterator has more elements, ""next()"" which returns the next element in the iteration, and ""remove()"" which removes the last element returned by ""next()"". The class also has a field ""d"" of type ""boolean"" which is used to keep track of whether the last element returned by ""next()"" has been removed. This is a Java class that implements the Set interface for a map. It provides methods for adding, removing, and checking the presence of entries in the map, as well as iterating over the entries. The class is named ""h"" and is defined as a final class, which means it cannot be extended or subclassed. It also implements the Set interface, which provides a set of methods for working with sets. The class has a constructor that takes no arguments, and it has a number of methods that are defined in the Set interface, such as add, remove, contains, and size. It also has a number of other methods that are specific to the map, such as get and put. This is a Java class that implements the Set interface, specifically the Set interface for a map. It has a constructor that takes no arguments, and it has methods for adding, removing, and checking the presence of elements in the set. It also has methods for iterating over the elements in the set, and for checking the size and emptiness of the set. The class is defined using the ""final"" keyword, which means that it cannot be subclassed. This is a Java class that implements the Iterator and Map.Entry interfaces. It is used to iterate over the entries of a map and also to create a new map entry. The class has a field called ""d"" which is a reference to the map that the iterator is iterating over. The class also has a field called ""a"" which is the number of entries in the map. The class has a method called ""next"" which returns the next entry in the map, and a method called ""hasNext"" which returns true if there are more entries in the map. The class also has methods for getting and setting the key and value of the entry, as well as a method for removing the entry from the map.

The methods take a VelocityTracker object and an integer index as input, and return a float value representing the velocity. This is a Java class named ""x"" that contains a static final variable ""a"" of type ""ag"". The class also contains a static initialization block that sets the value of ""a"" based on the version of Android being used. The class also contains several static methods that call methods on ""a"" and pass in various parameters. This code defines a class named ""y"" that implements the ""ag"" interface. The class has several methods that are used to interact with a ""View"" object, such as invalidating the view, posting a runnable, and determining the view's background. The class also has several fields that are used to store information about the view, such as its width and height. The code defines a class named ""z"" that extends another class named ""y"". The class ""z"" overrides the method ""e"" from the superclass ""y"" and returns a boolean value indicating whether the view passed as an argument is enabled or not. The method ""e"" is defined in the Android framework and is used to determine whether a view is enabled or not. The code defines an interface named ""a"" with four methods: ""a"" with an integer parameter, ""a"" with a View parameter, ""a"" with a View parameter and a float parameter, and ""b"" with a View parameter. The code defines an abstract class named ""aa"" that has several methods with different signatures. The methods are used to perform various actions on a view, such as setting the view's size, position, and visibility. The class also has several abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. This code defines a custom view group layout parameter class called ""b"" that extends the Android framework class ""ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams"". The class has several constructors that allow it to be initialized with different types of parameters, and it also has several instance variables that store values for the layout parameters. The code defines a class named `c` that implements the `Parcelable.Creator` interface for the `DrawerLayout.SavedState` class. The `createFromParcel` method creates a new instance of `DrawerLayout.SavedState` from a `Parcel` object, and the `newArray` method creates a new array of `DrawerLayout.SavedState` objects. This is a Java class named ""d"" that extends the ""aa"" class and implements the ""Runnable"" interface.

The code tries to fetch two methods and fields from the ""View"" class, and if it succeeds, it sets the ""mRecreateDisplayList"" field to true and invokes the ""getDisplayList"" method with null arguments. If any of these operations fail, it logs an error message. The code defines a class named `x` that extends `v` and overrides the `a` method of `SlidingPaneLayout`. The method takes two parameters: `slidingPaneLayout` and `view`. It then calls the `a` method of the `android.support.v4.view.x` class with the `view` parameter and the `d` property of the `LayoutParams` of the `view` parameter. The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. The code defines a class called ""z"" that implements the ""Interpolator"" interface.

The class has several abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. The class also has several instance variables, including a SQLiteDatabase object, a config object, and a session object. The class also has several methods that perform various database operations, such as inserting, deleting, and updating entities. This is a Java abstract class named ""b"" that has several fields and methods. The class is abstract because it does not have a concrete implementation. The fields include a Map of DAO classes and their corresponding configuration, a SQLiteDatabase object, and an integer representing the schema version. The methods include a constructor, a method to get the database object, a method to get the schema version, a method to create a new session, a method to create a new session with a specific configuration, and a method to register a DAO class. This is a Java class named ""c"" that represents a database connection. It has methods for performing various database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data. The class also has a method for starting an asynchronous session, which allows for multiple database operations to be performed in parallel. The class is generic, meaning it can be used with different types of data, such as strings, integers, or custom objects. The code defines a custom exception class named ""d"" that extends the built-in ""SQLException"" class. The class has three constructors: a default constructor, a constructor that takes a string argument, and a constructor that takes a string and a throwable argument. The ""a"" method is overridden to set the initial cause of the exception, which is done by calling the ""initCause"" method on the superclass. If an exception is thrown while trying to set the initial cause, the method logs an error message and continues to set the initial cause to the original throwable. This code defines a class called ""e"" that contains four static methods for logging messages with different levels of severity. The methods take a string message and an optional Throwable object as parameters, and return an integer value indicating the level of the log message.

This code defines a class named ""a"" that represents a configuration for a DAO (Data Access Object) in an Android application. The class has several fields and methods that are used to configure the DAO, such as the database to use, the table name, and the properties of the objects that the DAO will operate on. The class also has a method for creating a new instance of the DAO, and another method for configuring the DAO to use a specific type of database (either a session or a persistent database). This code defines a class named ""b"" that implements the Cursor interface. The class has a private field named ""a"" of type CursorWindow, and two other private fields named ""b"" and ""c"" that store the current position and the total number of rows in the cursor, respectively. The class also defines several methods that are required by the Cursor interface, such as getBlob(), getDouble(), and getString(). These methods simply delegate to the corresponding methods of the ""a"" field. The class also defines several other methods that are not part of the Cursor interface, such as moveToPosition() and isLast(). These methods are used to navigate the cursor and determine its position. This is a Java class named ""c"" that represents a map data structure. It has a private field ""a"" of type ""d<T>[]"" which is an array of objects of type ""d<T>"". It also has private fields ""b"", ""c"", and ""d"" of type ""int"". The class has several methods, including a constructor, ""a"", ""a(int)"", ""a(long, T)"", ""b"", ""b(int)"", and ""b(long)"". These methods are used to add, remove, and retrieve elements from the map, as well as to resize the map when necessary. The code defines a generic class named `d` with a single constructor that takes three parameters: `j`, `t`, and `dVar`. The constructor initializes the instance variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with the values of `j`, `t`, and `dVar`, respectively. This is a Java class that contains several methods for building SQL queries. The methods include:

* `a(String, String, String[])`: builds a DELETE query with a WHERE clause.
* `a(String, String[])`: builds a SELECT query with a WHERE clause.
* `a(String, String, String[], String[])`: builds an UPDATE query with a WHERE clause.
* `a(StringBuilder, int)`: appends a question mark to a StringBuilder for use in a prepared statement.
* `a(StringBuilder, String)`: appends a string to a StringBuilder with single quotes around it.
* `a(StringBuilder, String, String)`: appends a string to a StringBuilder with single quotes around it and a dot before the string.
* `a(StringBuilder, String, String[])`: appends a string to a StringBuilder with single quotes around it and a dot before the string, and also appends a question mark for each element in the array.
* `b(String, String, String[])`: builds a SELECT query with a WHERE clause and a GROUP BY clause.
* `b(StringBuilder, String, String[])`: appends a string to a StringBuilder with single quotes around it and a dot before the string, and also appends a question mark for each element in the array.

These methods are used to build SQL queries in a way that is safe and easy to use, by avoiding common SQL injection vulnerabilities and providing a simple and consistent way to build queries. This is a Java class that represents a database table. It has a private field for the SQLiteDatabase object, a private field for the table name, and private fields for the column names and data types. It also has private fields for the SQLiteStatement objects for the different types of queries that can be performed on the table. The class has methods for compiling the SQLiteStatement objects, as well as methods for generating the SQL queries for inserting, updating, and deleting rows in the table. This is a Java code snippet that defines an abstract class named ""a"" with a generic type parameter ""T"". The class has several fields and methods, including a constructor that takes in an instance of a generic type ""a.a.a.a<T, ?>"" and a string array, and a method named ""a"" that throws an exception if the method is called from a different thread than the one that created the instance. This is a generic class named ""b"" that has two type parameters: ""T"" and ""Q"", where ""Q"" extends the abstract class ""a"" with type parameter ""T"". The class has four fields: ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", and ""d"", where ""a"" is a string, ""b"" is a reference to a class that implements the ""a"" interface with type parameter ""T"", ""c"" is an array of strings, and ""d"" is a sparse array of weak references to instances of ""Q"". The class has a constructor that takes three arguments: ""aVar"", ""str"", and ""strArr"". The constructor initializes the fields ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"" with the corresponding arguments. The class also has a method named ""a"" that returns an instance of ""Q"". The method first checks if there is already an instance of ""Q"" in the sparse array ""d"" for the current thread ID. If there is, it returns the instance. Otherwise, it calls the abstract method ""b"" to create a new instance of ""Q"", and then adds the new instance to the sparse array ""d"" for the current thread ID. The method also copies the contents of the array ""c"" into the ""d"" field of the new instance of ""Q"". The class also has a method named ""c"" that removes any null references from the sparse array ""d"" for the current thread ID. This code defines a generic class named ""c"" that extends a class named ""a"" and has a private field named ""h"" of type ""e"" and two private fields named ""f"" and ""g"" of type ""int"". The class has a constructor that takes an ""e"" object, a ""com.fw.ttze.a.a.a.a"" object, a string, an array of strings, and two integers as parameters. It also has a static method named ""a"" that takes a ""com.fw.ttze.a.a.a.a"" object, a string, an array of objects, and two integers as parameters and returns a new instance of the class. The class also has two methods named ""b"" and ""c"" that return a list of objects and a single object, respectively. This code defines a class named `e` that extends a class named `b` and implements an interface named `c`. The class has two private fields: `e` and `f`, which are both integers. The constructor takes five parameters: an instance of a class named `a`, a string, an array of strings, an integer, and another integer. The `b` method returns a new instance of the class `c`, which is a subclass of `e`.

This is a Java class named ""f"" that represents a query for a database table. It has several methods for building the query, such as ""a"" for adding a WHERE clause, ""b"" for adding an ORDER BY clause, and ""c"" for executing the query and returning the results. The class also has several fields, such as ""g"" for the table name, ""h"" for the column name, and ""i"" and ""j"" for the limit and offset values. The class is generic, meaning it can be used with different types of data. The code defines an interface named ""g"" with two methods: ""a"" that takes a StringBuilder and a String as parameters, and ""a"" that takes a List of Objects as a parameter. The code defines an abstract class named ""h"" that implements an interface named ""g"". The class has three fields: ""b"", ""a"", and ""c"". The ""b"" field is an Object and is set in the constructor. The ""a"" field is a boolean and is set to true. The ""c"" field is an Object array and is set to null. The class has a method named ""a"" that takes a List of Objects as an argument. The method adds the value of the ""b"" field to the list if the ""a"" field is true, and then adds the values of the ""c"" field to the list if it is not null. This code defines a class named ""i"" that extends another class named ""h"". The class ""i"" has two final fields: ""d"" of type ""com.fw.ttze.a.a.a.g"" and ""e"" of type ""String"". The constructor of the class ""i"" takes three parameters: ""gVar"" of type ""com.fw.ttze.a.a.a.g"", ""str"" of type ""String"", and ""obj"" of type ""Object"". The constructor initializes the fields ""d"" and ""e"" with the values of the parameters. The class ""i"" also has a method named ""a"" that takes a ""StringBuilder"" and a ""String"" as parameters and appends a string representation of the object to the ""StringBuilder"". The method ""a"" first appends the value of the parameter ""str"" to the ""StringBuilder"" if it is not null. Then, it appends a string representation of the object to the ""StringBuilder"" in the format ""d.e'str'"". This code defines a class named ""a"" that implements the View.OnClickListener interface. The class has a final field named ""a"" that refers to an instance of the FwAdDetailActivity class. The constructor of the class takes a FwAdDetailActivity object as a parameter and assigns it to the ""a"" field. The onClick method of the class is overridden to get the package manager and launch intent for the package name of the FwAdDetailActivity object. The intent is then started using the startActivity method. This code defines a custom `BroadcastReceiver` class named `AdDetailActivity$DownloadProgressReceiver` that is used to receive broadcasts from the system when the download progress of an ad has changed. The receiver is defined as a nested class inside the `AdDetailActivity` class.

The `onReceive()` method of the receiver is called when the system sends a broadcast with the `com.fw.ttze.b.a.bm` and `com.fw.ttze.b.a.bn` extras. The method checks if the ad ID in the extras matches the ID of the ad being downloaded, and if so, it updates the progress bar and button visibility based on the download progress. This code defines a class named `b` that implements the `View.OnClickListener` interface. The class has two fields: `a` and `b`. The `a` field is a `File` object, and the `b` field is a `FwAdDetailActivity` object. The `b` field is passed to the constructor, and the `a` field is passed to the `onClick` method. The `onClick` method sets the `clickable` property of the `button` field to `false`, and then calls several methods on the `FwAdDetailActivity` object, including `a`, `W`, `X`, and `a`. The `a` method is called with the `adInfo` object, the `i` variable, and `true` as arguments. The `button2` and `button3` fields are set to `8` and `8`, respectively, and the `progressBar` field is set to `0`. This code defines a class named ""c"" that implements the ""OnClickListener"" interface. The class has a constructor that takes a single argument of type ""FwAdDetailActivity"". The class also has a field named ""a"" that is a reference to the ""FwAdDetailActivity"" object that was passed to the constructor. The class's ""onClick"" method is overridden to handle clicks on a view. When the method is called, it retrieves the context, ad information, and ad position from the ""FwAdDetailActivity"" object, and then calls a method named ""a"" on the ""com.fw.ttze.e.k"" class with these arguments. This code defines a class named ""d"" that implements the ""OnClickListener"" interface. The class has two fields: ""a"" and ""b"". The ""a"" field is a ""File"" object, and the ""b"" field is a ""FwAdDetailActivity"" object. The class also has a constructor that takes a ""FwAdDetailActivity"" object and a ""File"" object as parameters. The ""onClick"" method is overridden to hide the ""button"" and ""button2"" views, show a ""progressBar"", and call the ""a"" method on the ""FwAdDetailActivity"" object with the ""File"" object as a parameter. The method also calls the ""a"" method on the ""FwAdDetailActivity"" object with the ""AdInfo"" object and ""5"" as parameters, and loops through the ""P"" list to call the ""a"" method on the ""FwAdDetailActivity"" object with each ""AdInfo"" object and ""true"" as parameters. This is an AsyncTask class that extends the AsyncTask class in Android. It has four methods: doInBackground, onPostExecute, onPreExecute, and protected void onProgressUpdate. The doInBackground method takes an Integer array as input and returns a List of AppWallAdInfo objects. The onPostExecute method takes a List of AppWallAdInfo objects as input and removes all views from a RelativeLayout and adds new views based on the list. The onPreExecute method initializes the FwAppWallManager and removes all views from a RelativeLayout.
