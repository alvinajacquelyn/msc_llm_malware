(start)
This is a Java class named ""ACall"" that contains a number of native methods, which are methods that are implemented in native code (i.e., not in Java). The class also contains a number of static initializer blocks, which are used to load the native libraries that contain the implementations of the native methods. The class is designed to be used as a singleton, meaning that there is only one instance of the class and it is created on demand. This code defines a custom class loader that extends the `DexClassLoader` class and overrides the `getResourceAsStream`, `getResource`, and `getResources` methods to delegate to the parent class loader. The `mClassLoader` field is used to store the parent class loader, and the `MyClassLoader` constructor takes the same parameters as the `DexClassLoader` constructor. The `getResourceAsStream`, `getResource`, and `getResources` methods return the result of calling the corresponding method on the `mClassLoader` field. This is a Java class named ""Util"" that contains a variety of static methods for performing various tasks, such as checking for updates, copying files, and running code. The class also contains a number of private fields and methods that are used to implement these methods. This code defines a custom BroadcastReceiver class named Lceceiver that overrides the onReceive() method. The method first checks if a custom class loader is available, and if so, it loads the class of the receiver using the custom class loader. If the custom class loader is not available, it uses the default class loader. The method then creates an instance of the receiver class using the loaded class, and calls the onReceive() method on the instance. The method also calls two methods named c1() and c2() on the instance of the receiver class. This code defines a custom BroadcastReceiver class named SR that overrides the onReceive method. The method first checks if a custom class loader is available, and if so, it loads the class of the real BroadcastReceiver using the custom class loader. If the custom class loader is not available, it uses the default class loader. The method then creates an instance of the real BroadcastReceiver using the loaded class, and calls the onReceive method on the real receiver. This is a Java class that extends the Android `Application` class and overrides its methods to provide custom behavior. The class uses a `DexClassLoader` to load a custom `Application` class from a different dex file, and then instantiates the custom `Application` class and calls its `onCreate()`, `onTerminate()`, `onConfigurationChanged()`, `onLowMemory()`, and `onTrimMemory()` methods. The class also provides a `getBaseContext()` method to return the base context of the custom `Application` class. The code defines a static final class called ""drawable"" with a static final integer field called ""icon"" with the value 0x7f020000. The code defines a class called ""layout"" with a static final field called ""main"" that has a value of 0x7f030000. The code defines a class called R that contains three nested classes: drawable, layout, and string. Each of these classes contains a set of integer constants that represent the identifiers for various resources in the Android application. The integer constants are assigned unique values, starting from 0x7f020000 for the drawable class, 0x7f030000 for the layout class, and 0x7f040000 for the string class. The values are assigned in a way that allows them to be easily distinguished from each other and from other resources in the application. The code defines a class called ""string"" with two static final fields called ""hello"" and ""app_name"". The values of these fields are 0x7f040000 and 0x7f040001, respectively.
