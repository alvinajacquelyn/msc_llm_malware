The code defines a class named ""a"" that extends the Android Application class. The ""onCreate"" method is overridden to call the ""super.onCreate"" method and then log a message using the ""u.i"" method with the ""this"" reference as the first argument and the integer 0 as the second argument. This code defines a custom class loader that extends the default class loader in Java. The class loader is defined as a subclass of `ClassLoader` and has a constructor that takes a `ClassLoader` object as a parameter. The `loadClass` method is overridden to first try to load the class using the default class loader, and then try to load the class using the `ClassLoader` object passed to the constructor. If the class is not found using either method, the method throws a `ClassNotFoundException`. This code defines a class called ""u"" in Java, which has several static methods for interacting with the Android SDK. The class has a field called ""SDKVERSION_CODE"" that is set to a string value of ""503"", and another field called ""SDKVERSION_NAME"" that is set to a string value of ""V201405135.0.3"". The class also has a native method called ""di"" that takes a ""Context"" object and an integer as arguments, and a non-native method called ""i"" that takes a ""Context"" object and an integer as arguments. The ""i"" method calls the ""di"" method and passes it the ""Context"" object and the integer argument. The code defines a class named ""a"" with a private static field ""a"" that is initialized to ""http://api.admob.com"". The class also contains a public static method ""a"" that takes no arguments and returns a boolean value. The method first checks if the string ""i.a"" and ""b.c"" are contained in the ""a"" field. If they are, the method returns true. Otherwise, the method calls the ""b"" method and then returns false. The ""b"" method sets the system to run finalizers on exit and then exits the program with a status code of 0. The code defines a class named `b` with a static method named `a`. The method checks if the string ""http://mm.admob.com"" contains the substring ""m.a"", and if it does, it sets a boolean variable `z` to `true`. If `z` is `false` or if the method `a.b()` returns `false`, the method returns `false`. If the string ""http://r.admob.com/ad_source.php"" ends with ""php"" and contains the substrings ""dmo"" and "".a"", the method returns `true`. Otherwise, the method calls `a.b()` and returns `false`. The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. This code defines a class called Proxy that implements the IMarketBillingService interface. The class has a private field called a, which is an instance of the IBinder class. The constructor takes an IBinder object as an argument and assigns it to the a field. The class also implements the a method, which is the only method in the interface. This method takes a Bundle object as an argument and returns a Bundle object. The method first obtains two Parcel objects, obtain and obtain2, and then writes the interface token and the Bundle object to the Parcel objects. It then calls the transact method on the a field, passing in the Parcel objects and a flag indicating that the method should not wait for a response. Finally, the method reads the exception from the Parcel object and returns the Bundle object read from the Parcel object. The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. This code is a Java class that checks the version of the app and kills the process if the version is not the expected one. The code defines a custom adapter class named ""aa"" that extends the Android framework class ""ArrayAdapter"". The class has a constructor that takes a ""FileManagerActivity"" object, a ""Context"" object, and a ""List"" object as parameters. The constructor initializes the class variables ""a"" and ""b"" with the values passed in as parameters. The ""getView"" method is overridden to throw a ""UnsupportedOperationException"" with the message ""Method not decompiled"".

The code defines a class named `ab` that implements the `View.OnClickListener` interface. The class has two private fields: `a` and `b`. The constructor takes two arguments: `aa` and `String`. The `onClick` method is overridden to show an alert dialog with two buttons: ""OK"" and ""Cancel"". When the ""OK"" button is clicked, the `ac` class is instantiated with the `this` reference and the `b` field, and the `onClick` method is called on the `ac` instance. The code defines a class named `ac` that implements the `OnClickListener` interface. The class has two private fields: `a` and `b`. The `a` field is an instance of `ab`, and the `b` field is a `String`. The `ac` class has a constructor that takes an instance of `ab` and a `String` as arguments. The `onClick` method is overridden to perform the following actions: 1. Get the `aa` instance from the `ab` instance. 2. Get the `FileManagerActivity` instance from the `aa` instance. 3. Get the `String` value from the `FileManagerActivity` instance. 4. Call the `ad.a` method with the `String` value and the `b` field value. 5. Get the `aa` instance from the `ab` instance. 6. Get the `FileManagerActivity` instance from the `aa` instance. 7. Call the `FileManagerActivity.a` method. This code defines a class named ""ad"" that provides various methods for working with files and directories. The class has several static methods that can be used to create, read, write, and delete files and directories, as well as to list the contents of a directory. The class also has a constructor that takes a context and a string, which can be used to create a new instance of the class with a specific external storage directory. The code defines a class named ""ae"" that implements the ""FilenameFilter"" interface. The class has a private field ""a"" of type ""int"" and a constructor that initializes ""a"" with the value passed to the constructor. The ""accept"" method of the class checks the extension of the file name passed to it and returns true if the extension matches one of the following: "".recording"", "".aac"", or "".learning"", "".txt"", or "".TXT"". If none of these conditions are met, the method returns false. This code defines a class called ""af"" that implements the ""FilenameFilter"" interface. The class has a private field ""a"" that is initialized with a value in the constructor. The ""accept"" method of the class checks if the file name ends with "".learning"", "".txt"", or "".TXT"", or if it ends with "".recording"" or "".aac"". If the file name ends with one of these extensions, the method returns ""true"". If the file name ends with "".recording"" or "".aac"", the method returns ""true"". If the file name is a directory, the method returns ""true"". Otherwise, the method returns ""false"". The code defines a class named ""ag"" with a static method ""a"" that takes a ""Resources"" object as an argument and initializes several static Bitmap fields with the corresponding drawable resources. The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. This code defines a class named `ai` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has several instance variables, including `a`, `b`, `f20c`, and `d`. The constructor takes four parameters: `ah`, `Handler`, `int`, and `Context`. The `run()` method sends an empty message to the `Handler` and then performs different actions based on the value of `f20c`. If `f20c` is 1, it calls the `a()` method on an instance of `i` and then calls the `b()` method on the `Handler`. If `f20c` is 0, it calls the `a()` method on an instance of `i` and then calls the `a()` method on the `Handler`. If `f20c` is 2, it calls the `d()` method on an instance of `i` and then calls the `b()` method on the `Handler`. If `f20c` is 3, it calls the `c()` method on an instance of `i` and then calls the `b()` method on the `Handler`. If `f20c` is 4, it calls the `e()` method on an instance of `i` and then calls the `b()` method on the `Handler`. The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. This is a Java class that extends the Thread class and implements the Runnable interface. It has several instance variables, including a boolean variable ""a"" that is set to true, a KeyBoards object ""b"", a SurfaceHolder object ""f21c"", a KeyBoards object ""d"", and two integer variables ""e"" and ""f"". The class also has a constructor that takes three arguments: a KeyBoards object, a SurfaceHolder object, and a KeyBoards object. The run() method is where the magic happens. It uses a while loop to continuously check the value of the ""a"" variable, and if it is true, it will execute the code inside the loop. The loop first tries to obtain a canvas from the SurfaceHolder object using the lockCanvas() method. If the canvas is not null, it will then call the a() method on each object in the ""f"" and ""g"" lists, passing in the canvas, the current x, y, and z values, and the current e and f values. Finally, it will unlock the canvas using the unlockCanvasAndPost() method.

This is a Java class named ""cb"" that extends the Thread class and has a single constructor that takes a ""ca"" object as a parameter. The class has a single method named ""run"" that is executed when the thread is started. The method contains a loop that checks the value of a boolean variable ""z"" and a variable ""i"" that is used to index into an array of ""cr"" objects. The loop also uses the ""System.currentTimeMillis()"" method to get the current time in milliseconds and the ""sleep()"" method to pause the thread for 5 milliseconds. If the value of ""z"" is false or if the index ""i"" is greater than or equal to the length of the array, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the method calls a method named ""a"" on the ""ca"" object and increments the value of ""i"". This code defines a class named `cc` that implements the `View.OnClickListener` interface. The class has a constructor that takes a `Navigator` object as a parameter, and it has an `onClick` method that is called when the user clicks on a view.

The code defines a class named ""dx"" that implements the ""OnClickListener"" interface. The class has a constructor that takes a ""SongsListActivity"" object as a parameter, and it has an ""onClick"" method that sets the background color and text color of two text views and sets the adapter of a list view to a custom adapter. This code defines a class named ""dy"" that implements the ""OnClickListener"" interface. The class has a constructor that takes a ""SongsListActivity"" object as a parameter, and it has an ""onClick"" method that is called when the user clicks on a view. The method sets the background color and text color of two text views, and it sets the adapter of a list view to an instance of the ""ea"" class. The code defines a class named `dz` that implements the `OnItemClickListener` interface for a `ListView`. The `dz` class has a reference to the `SongsListActivity` class, which is used to access the `ListView` and its adapter. When an item is clicked in the `ListView`, the `onItemClick()` method is called, which gets the adapter for the `ListView` and checks the type of the item that was clicked. If the item is a song, the method calls the `a()` method of the `SongsListActivity` class with the index of the song that was clicked. If the item is a playlist, the method calls the `a()` method with the name of the playlist that was clicked. This code defines a class called `e` that extends another class called `d`. It also has a field called `f46c` of type `BillingService`. The constructor takes a `BillingService` object as a parameter and assigns it to the `f46c` field. The `d()` method is overridden to check if the billing service is supported by calling the `a()` method on the `BillingService` object and checking the response code. If the response code is `RESULT_OK`, the method returns a value of `l.a`. This is an Android Java code for a custom adapter class named ""ea"" that extends the ""ArrayAdapter"" class. The class is used to display a list of songs in a specific format. The constructor takes in a ""SongsListActivity"" object, a ""Context"" object, a ""List"" object, and an ""int"" value. The ""getView"" method is overridden to inflate a custom layout for each item in the list, and to set the text and image for each item based on the data in the ""List"" object. The class also has a field ""a"" that is an ""int"" value, and a field ""b"" that is a ""SongsListActivity"" object. The code defines a class named ""eb"" that implements the ""OnClickListener"" interface. The class has two private fields: ""a"" and ""b"". The constructor takes two arguments: ""eaVar"" and ""str"". The ""onClick"" method is overridden to display an alert dialog with two buttons: ""ok"" and ""cancel"". When the ""ok"" button is clicked, the method ""ec"" is called with the ""b"" field as an argument. This code defines a class named ""ec"" that implements the ""OnClickListener"" interface. The class has two fields: ""a"" and ""b"". The ""a"" field is an instance of the ""eb"" class, and the ""b"" field is a string. The ""onClick"" method is overridden to perform some actions when the dialog is clicked. The method first retrieves the ""ea"" and ""SongsListActivity"" instances from the ""a"" and ""b"" fields, respectively. It then calls the ""a"" method on the ""ea"" instance to add the string to the list of songs, and then calls the ""a"" method on the ""SongsListActivity"" instance to update the list of songs. This code defines a custom `Handler` class named `ed` that extends the Android `Handler` class. The `ed` class has a constructor that takes a `Splash` object as a parameter, and it overrides the `handleMessage` method to handle messages with specific `what` values. The `handleMessage` method checks the `what` value of the message and performs different actions based on the value. The code defines a class named `ee` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has a constructor that takes a `Splash` object as a parameter, and it has an `a` field that is also a `Splash` object. The `run()` method of the class creates a new `Handler` object and calls the `a()` method of the `ah` object, passing in the `Handler` object and the application context as parameters. The code defines a class named `f` that extends `d` and has a constructor that takes a `BillingService` object, an integer, and a string array as parameters. The class has a field named `d` that is a `BillingService` object, and a field named `f48c` that is a string array. The `d()` method is overridden to create a bundle with the `CONFIRM_NOTIFICATIONS` key and the `NOTIFY_IDS` key set to the value of the `f48c` field. The method then calls the `a()` method on the `BillingService` object with the created bundle as a parameter, and returns the `REQUEST_ID` value from the response bundle.

The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package. The code defines a class called MyCountThreadYNTY that extends the Thread class. The class has a constructor that takes no arguments. The run method is overridden to perform a loop that sleeps for 30 minutes and then invokes the againInvoke method on the Splash class. This is a Java class named ""Navigator"" that extends the ""LinearLayout"" class. It has several private variables, including an ""ImageView"" named ""a"", ""b"", ""f11c"", and ""d"", as well as an ""OverviewBar"" named ""e"" and a ""KeyBoards"" named ""f"". The class has several methods, including ""a"", ""a(KeyBoards keyBoards)"", ""b"", ""c"", and ""onFinishInflate"". The ""onFinishInflate"" method is called when the layout is finished inflating, and it initializes the private variables and sets up the listeners for the ""ImageView"" objects. The code defines a class named ""o"" that implements the ""ServiceConnection"" interface. The class has a constructor that takes a ""DownloadMoreSongsActivity"" object as a parameter. The class also has two methods: ""onServiceConnected"" and ""onServiceDisconnected"". In ""onServiceConnected"", the class sets the ""f"" field of the ""DownloadMoreSongsActivity"" object to the ""a"" method of the ""x"" object, which is returned by the ""a()"" method of the ""IBinder"" object. The class then calls the ""a()"" method of the ""DownloadMoreSongsActivity"" object to start the download process. In ""onServiceDisconnected"", the class sets the ""f"" field of the ""DownloadMoreSongsActivity"" object to null. The code is a Java class that represents a type declaration, specifically a type declaration for a class named ""TypeDeclaration"" in the ""org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom"" package. The code defines a class named `p` that extends the `Handler` class. It has a constructor that takes a `DownloadMoreSongsActivity` object as a parameter and assigns it to a field named `a`. The `handleMessage` method overrides the `Handler` method and checks the `what` value of the `Message` object. If the `what` value is 0, it updates the progress bar of the `DownloadMoreSongsActivity` object and increments the progress value. If the `what` value is 2, it sets the visibility of the progress bar to invisible. If the `what` value is 1, it sets the visibility of the progress bar to visible. This code defines a custom view called PianoView that extends LinearLayout. It has two child views, a KeyBoards object and a Navigator object, which are both defined in the code. The PianoView class overrides the onFinishInflate method to set up the child views and their relationships. Specifically, it finds the Navigator and KeyBoards views by ID and sets the Navigator's a method to the KeyBoards object. This code defines a class named `q` that implements the `AdapterView.OnItemClickListener` interface. The class has a constructor that takes a `DownloadMoreSongsActivity` object as a parameter, and it has an `onItemClick` method that is called when an item is clicked in the `AdapterView`. The method checks if the song exists in the device, and if it does, it shows a toast message. If the song does not exist, it calls the `a` method of the `DownloadMoreSongsActivity` object, which is not shown in the code snippet. This code defines a custom adapter for a list view in an Android app. The adapter is a subclass of ArrayAdapter, and it is used to display a list of songs that can be downloaded from a server.

The code defines a class named ""s"" with five fields: ""a"", ""b"", ""f55c"", ""d"", and ""f"". The class also has a constructor that takes a single argument of type ""DownloadMoreSongsActivity"". The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package, and it is used to represent a type declaration in the Eclipse JDT (Java Development Toolkit) code analysis framework. This code defines a class called ""SongsListActivity"" that extends the ""Activity"" class in Android. The class has a number of static fields and methods that are used to display a list of songs in the app. The code also defines a custom adapter class called ""ea"" that is used to display the list of songs. This code defines a class called Splash that extends the Android Activity class. It has several instance variables, including a ProgressBar, a LuMan object, and a Ckey object. The class also has several methods, including onCreate, onStart, onStop, againInvoke, and onceInit. The code also defines a MyCountThreadYNTY class that extends the Thread class and has a run method that repeatedly invokes the againInvoke method after a 30-minute delay. The code defines a class named `t` that extends `Handler`. The class has a constructor that takes a `DownloadService` object as a parameter. The `handleMessage` method is overridden to call the `b` method of the `y` object, which is a field of the `DownloadService` object. This code defines a custom `Handler` class named `u` that is used to handle messages sent from a `DownloadService` class. The `u` class has a constructor that takes a `DownloadService` object and two `String` parameters, and it sets the `a` field to the `DownloadService` object and the `b` and `f56c` fields to the two `String` parameters. The `handleMessage` method is overridden to handle messages sent from the `DownloadService` object. When a message with the `what` field set to 1 is received, the method removes the `b` field from the `f5c` set of the `DownloadService` object and calls the `a` method of the `y` object with the `f56c` field as an argument. When a message with any other `what` field value is received, the method removes the `b` field from the `f5c` set of the `DownloadService` object and calls the `c` method of the `y` object. This is a Java class that implements the `a` method of the `g` interface. The method takes an `InputStream` and an `int` as parameters, and it writes the contents of the `InputStream` to a file. The file is specified by the `File` object passed to the constructor. The method also sends a message to a `Handler` object every second to update the progress of the download. This code defines a class named `w` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The class has four private fields: `a`, `b`, `f57c`, and `d`. The constructor takes four parameters: `downloadService`, `handler`, `gVar`, and `file`. The `run()` method is defined, which tries to download a file using the `DownloadService` and `com.cat.pianocgoerb.a.c.a()` methods. If the download is successful, it sends an empty message to the `handler` with the code 1. If the download fails, it deletes the file and sends an empty message to the `handler` with the code 0. If an exception occurs, it sends an empty message to the `handler` with the code 0 and throws the exception. The code defines a class named `x` that extends `Binder` and has a field named `a` of type `DownloadService`. The constructor takes a `DownloadService` object as a parameter and assigns it to the `a` field. The `a()` method returns the `DownloadService` object that was assigned to the `a` field in the constructor. The code defines an interface named ""y"" with three methods: ""a"" which takes a string as a parameter, ""b"" which does not take any parameters, and ""c"" which does not take any parameters.

The class also has a private field `b` of type `e` and a private final field `f17c` of type `HttpContext` and a private final field `d` of type `CookieStore`. The constructor of the class sets the attribute ""http.cookie-store"" in the `f17c` field to the `d` field. The `a()` method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` with the message ""Method not decompiled"". This code defines a custom implementation of the `BasicCookieStore` class, which is a class in the `org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicCookieStore` package. The custom implementation, `d`, overrides the `addCookie` and `addCookies` methods to add the cookies to a list of cookies that are stored in a `c` object. The `clear` method is also overridden to clear the list of cookies. The `getCookies` method returns the list of cookies that are stored in the `c` object. The code defines an interface named `e` that has a single method named `a()` that returns an object of type `Credentials`. The code defines a class named `f` that extends `BasicCredentialsProvider` and overrides the `getCredentials` method. The method takes an `AuthScope` object as a parameter and returns a `Credentials` object. The method first checks if the credentials are already available in the superclass, and if so, returns them. If the credentials are not available, the method creates a new `e` object and sets its `a` field to the value of the `b` field of the `c` object passed in the constructor. The method then returns the `a` field of the `e` object. The code defines an abstract class named ""g"" that has a field for a string and a field for a map.
