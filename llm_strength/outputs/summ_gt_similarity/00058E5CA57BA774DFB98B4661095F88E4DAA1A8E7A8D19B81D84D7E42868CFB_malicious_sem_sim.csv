Are there any similarities between the two texts? Each text starts after 'start' and ends before 'end':

This is first text: (start) 
The provided code defines 5 classes that extend the `RuntimeActivity` class and 2 classes that extend the `RuntimeReceiver` class. The classes are named `RuntimeAdplatTtsactivity1`, `RuntimeAdplatTtsactivity2`, `RuntimeAdplatTtsactivity3`, `RuntimeReceiver1`, `RuntimeReceiver2`, `RuntimeReceiver3`, `RuntimeReceiver4`, `RuntimeReceiver5`, `RuntimeService1`, and `RuntimeService2`.
 (end)
This is second text: (start) Dowgin is an advertisement library that is bundled with certain Android applications. It is a malicious advertising module that is distributed and bundled with other (usually legitimate) programmes. The advertising module is used to display advertising content while also silently gathering and forwarding information from the device. Dowgin provides users with advertising content. If the user is unaware of the module’s presence or objects to the nature of the advertising materials displayed, this behaviour may be considered unwanted. The module may also silently leak or harvest sensitive device information such as the device’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, location, contacts, and so on. (end)
