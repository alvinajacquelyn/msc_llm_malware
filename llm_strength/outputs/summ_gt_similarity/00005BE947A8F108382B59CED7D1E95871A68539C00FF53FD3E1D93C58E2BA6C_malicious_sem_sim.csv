Are there any similarities between the two texts? Each text starts after 'start' and ends before 'end':

This is first text: (start) 
The text describes several Java classes with various methods and fields. The classes include:

* ""a"" class: Implements the Serializable interface and has several private fields and methods.
* ""aa"" class: Extends AsyncTask and has a static method for registering a receiver to listen for package-related events on the Android platform.
* ""ab"" class: Extends RelativeLayout and has a constructor that sets the background color of the view to a dark gray color.
* ""ad"" class: Extends AsyncTask and has several private fields and methods.
* ""ag"" class: Extends LinearLayout and has a constructor that sets various properties and adds two child views.
* ""ah"" class: Implements the AnimationListener interface and has three methods.
* ""aj"" class: Extends the default WebViewClient class and overrides three methods.
* ""al"" class: Extends the BaseAdapter class and is used to display a list of items in a ListView.
* ""am"" class: Implements the OnClickListener interface and has two fields and a constructor that takes two arguments.
* ""an"" class: Has a final field named ""a"" of type ""ak"" and three private fields named ""b"", ""c"", and ""d"" of type ""ImageView"", ""TextView"", and ""LinearLayout"", respectively.

This is second text: (start) Dowgin is an advertisement library that is bundled with certain Android applications. It is a malicious advertising module that is distributed and bundled with other (usually legitimate) programmes. The advertising module is used to display advertising content while also silently gathering and forwarding information from the device. Dowgin provides users with advertising content. If the user is unaware of the module’s presence or objects to the nature of the advertising materials displayed, this behaviour may be considered unwanted. The module may also silently leak or harvest sensitive device information such as the device’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, location, contacts, and so on. (end)
