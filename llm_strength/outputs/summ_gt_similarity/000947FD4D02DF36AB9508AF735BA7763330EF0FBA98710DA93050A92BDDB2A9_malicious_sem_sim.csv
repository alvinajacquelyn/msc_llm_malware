Are there any similarities between the two texts? Each text starts after 'start' and ends before 'end':

This is first text: (start) 
The provided code defines several classes and interfaces in Java, including a custom class loader, a class called ""u"" with static methods and fields, and a class called ""a"" that handles events related to the Android activity lifecycle. The code also defines a class called ""ac"" that implements the Runnable interface and a class called ""ae"" that extends the Handler class. The code also defines an interface called ""af"" with a single method. The classes and interfaces have different methods and fields, and they seem to be related to different aspects of the Android operating system. The code is a Java class that extends the `TypeDeclaration` class from the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom` package.

This is second text: (start) Dowgin is an advertisement library that is bundled with certain Android applications. It is a malicious advertising module that is distributed and bundled with other (usually legitimate) programmes. The advertising module is used to display advertising content while also silently gathering and forwarding information from the device. Dowgin provides users with advertising content. If the user is unaware of the module’s presence or objects to the nature of the advertising materials displayed, this behaviour may be considered unwanted. The module may also silently leak or harvest sensitive device information such as the device’s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, location, contacts, and so on. (end)
